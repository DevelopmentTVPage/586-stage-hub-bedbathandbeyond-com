    "description": "Our new stainless steel rectangular step can features an innovative 'liner pocket' that stores and dispenses liners from inside the can for a faster liner change. The stainless steel liner rim grips the liner and keeps it hidden. And with no inner bucket, there's more space for trash. Strong wide steel pedal is designed to last, and our patented lid shox technology ensures a smooth, silent close every time. \n\nCode Q liner refill packs store perfectly in this can's liner pocket.\n\nLearn more: \nhttps:\/\/www.simplehuman.com\/55-litre-rectangular-step-can-stainless-steel-liner-rim",
