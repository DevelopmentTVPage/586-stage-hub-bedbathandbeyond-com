I'm going to use the seven inch santoku. We're gonna take off the bottom end right here. The lemon grass is fibrous, so you want to get to that nice center. So what we'll do is we're gonna cut this down. Cut this into two manageable sizes. We're gonna cut this straight down the middle. Now what I'm going to do is cut it nice and thin. So the santoku is a great knife to use, especially for the lemongrass. The fact that it's a very sharp knife is essential. Okay with the second one what we will do is we're going to use the width of the blade right here and we're going to smash. You don't want to have the blade facing you, it's too dangerous. Go down and turn it over. And you can stuff this bottom part here and actually throw this on the grill. Now this last piece of lemon grass, we're gonna cut this on a bias. So this is actually great for finishing soups. Okay we have lemon grass three different ways. Sliced for curries, we have a bias cut for soups, and smashed for grilling.",
