I'm going to use this 7 inch santoku knife here. The next thing I want to do is core the apple. Now that I have my different sections, I'm going to do some slicing. I'm going to be using a six inch utility knife. I'm going to grab the apple. Making my knuckle as a guide. The next is match sticks. What you want to do is cut planks put of this apple. Setting them up, you can simply cut across the other direction. That's going to be great fro something like a slaw. Similarly, I'm going to cut across the apple to make a chop. And here's our apple cut three ways, diced, matchstick, and slices.",
