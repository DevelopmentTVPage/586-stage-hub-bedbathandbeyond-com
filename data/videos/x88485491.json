    "description": "Effortlessly sparkling, streak-free windows with no droplets of residual dirty water with the Leifheit Dry&Clean Window Vacuum Wash windows, tiles, mirrors and shower cubicles and simply dry them with the window vacuum. The Dry&Clean demonstrates its high level of performance in any location, vacuuming every last drop of water from both horizontal and overhead surfaces. The automatic stand-by function switches the window vacuum to maximum suction mode when it makes contact with the window pane, offering an extra-long operating time of 35 minutes. The manual window vacuum can be extended with any of the Leifheit Click System handles, ideal for difficult-to-reach surfaces. A narrow nozzle (17 cm) for windows with glazing bars is available separately. A high-quality Leifheit product \"Made in Europe\".",
