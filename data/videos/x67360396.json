    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe're gonna cut carrots with a seven inch santoku knife. First I'll cut the tops off and then cut them in half. A good dice for carrots is an oblique cut which is great for soups and stews. And just start rotating the carrot back and forth. So we'll cut the larger parts in half and then go ahead and square these off so they don't roll around as you're trying to cut them. A sharp knife is really nice here as these are really hard to get through sometimes with a duller knife. Now that you have your rectangles, we're gonna cut them into smaller rectangles. Once you have your matchsticks, it's easier to cut a small dice. Going with the tip and then just rocking back with that santoku. It's great for sauteing or for stuffing. So we have a carrot cut three ways, oblique, matchstick, and small dice.",
