    "transcripts": "This animation shows exactly what happens to your body when you sit. Without BackJoy your pelvis tilts backwards, creating a c shaped slouch. Muscles that are supposed to hold your correct are flattened and are useless under your body weight. When you sit with a back Joy, everything changes. It tilts your pelvis and spine upright to a naturally supported position moving pressure and strain away from your lower back. It cuts your gluteus muscles and floats your pelvis above the sitting surface getting you optimal posture effortlessly. For the first time you'll actually feel your core muscles engaged while you sit. BackJoy won't cure back problems but it will relieve the pressures and strains that aggravate back pain. It's innovative design provides natural, safe, and effective relief so all you feel is comfort. Start sitting better today with BackJoy.",
