The first thing I do is cut the wings off. When I do whole animal butchery, one thing I like to tell people is let gravity do a lot of the work for you. The next thing we're going to do is take the breast off the frame. You can see the seam here. This is the keel bone. We want to make a long cut all the way down. We're going to work against the wish bone and you wanna stay against bone this whole way. \n\nHaving a nice sharp knife is good for this. Cut through the skin. So here we have our breast. The next thing I would like to do is take the leg and the thigh off in one piece and then we'll separate it. You want to follow one smooth cut along the side of the chicken exposing the leg joint. Insert the knife tip to free the joint. And then there's a little bit of muscle here called the oyster which is probably the best part of the chicken. You want to scoop that guy out. Don't leave that in there, it's delicious.\n\nWe have the leg and the thigh. You just want to press down between those. If you hit a bone while doing that, just stop, make a slight adjustment, and continue cutting. Don't try to saw through the bone. So here we have our chicken broken down into eight serving pieces. We have our wings, our breast, our legs, and our thighs. ",
