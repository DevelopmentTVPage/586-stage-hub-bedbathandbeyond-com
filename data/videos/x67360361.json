    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSo we're gonna carve a holiday turkey. I have a wonderful carving set. Nice firm blade and a carving fork to help steady everything. First thing I like to do, Insert the fork into the thigh and separate the leg. Having a knife is crucial. Going down the side of the turkey to the back bump. Using the tools to help you guide it along and pull the meat. Then we can go back and slice using the tip of the knife to free the ball joint from the thigh. The separates the leg and the thigh.\n\nThe next thing I am going to do is remove the breast. Make a slice along the keel bone and work forward to the wish bone that's our guideline. You can use the fork to help steady it and pull things as we're cutting. Keeping the knife against the rib. Using the tip of the knife to separate and slice free. We can then come back and cut the wing off of the breast. So now I'll slice the breast. Again, nice sharp knife making long folds. So here we have a magnificently roasted turkey, carved ready for the table. We have our wings, our leg and thigh, our breast, one slice one not, ready to eat.",
