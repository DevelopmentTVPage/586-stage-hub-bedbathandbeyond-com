    "transcripts": "At OXO, we know that large items like bowls and colanders can clutter your counter top and make it difficult to graph the item you want. Our nesting bowl and colander set has all the components neatly nested and ready to be used. The bowl has a matching colander and lid. The large set is ideal for pasta, green salads, chopped fruit, and more. The elevated ring on the bottom of the colander allows me to rinse fruit, vegetables, and pasta and set them back on the bowl so they don't drain all over the counter top. The sets combine more coarse durability along with tabletop appeal so you can not only drain your pasta, but also serve your pasta in the accompanying bowl. One of my favorite things about this set is you can prepare a dish, pop the lid on, and put it in the fridge until you're ready to serve. When you're done, nest the again for easy compact storage. Here's good tip, the bowls designers focused on the feet of the colander so delicate food wouldn't sit in water.",
