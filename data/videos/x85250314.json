    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Bryan from Pacific Play Tents and I welcome you to the world of our One Touch Play Tent. It comes in its own carry bag. All you do is pull it out, set it down on the ground, lift it up, and with one touch, your tent is immediately set up. Take the kit down, and now all you do is lift up, push in at the corners, lift up your tent and put it back on the carry bag and you're ready to go. The unique thing about our One Touch Play Tent, it's all UV treated. it has an FPS rating of 30, it has a waterproof polyethylene floor, a zipper front to close, double zippers to open inside or outside. You can put mesh windows on the to so the parent can see into the children and the children have plenty of ventilation on the inside. The other wonderful thing about this is it has a 400 ml polyurethane coating which also makes it water resistant. Again thank you for looking at our one touch play tent. I'm Bryan from Pacific Play Tents.\n",
