This six piece set features a pointed concealer brush, a powder brush, a shadow brush, a smudge brush and a lip brush.\n\nTo craft the perfect look for a night on the town, apply concealer under the eyes with the pointed concealer brush. Then, with the powder brush, trace a \u201c3\u201d with your bronzer, beginning just above your eyebrow and running it along your cheek and under your jaw. Gently blend in your bronzer before applying your powder with the powder brush. Afterwards, use the shadow brush to apply eye shadow along the crease.
