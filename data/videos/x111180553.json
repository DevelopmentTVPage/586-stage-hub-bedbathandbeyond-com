    "transcripts": "Hello, my name is Fabrite Sebotarra, Executive Chef for Waring. We have our Professional Induction Cook Top. Let's cook on it.\r\n\r\nNumber one, it's an electromagnetic transfer of heat. So it goes right from the cook top to the pan. It has seven settings. One, two, three, all the way up from low to high. It has a timer up to 99 minutes.\r\n\r\nI'm just gonna do some eggs. This is an induction-ready pan. I'll just put a couple eggs in here. You can use cast iron or you can use an 18 zero stainless steel. Very, very easy as you can see. All the settings are right in front. The LED readout is right in front. There is basically no flame, absolutely nothing. It's just from the induction to the pan. The heat is transferred this way. And you can see how easy, even heat is on the pan.\r\n\r\nThe minute you remove the pan, it stops cooking. It stops heating up anything, and it'll beep, too. So you can see, hear it? It's beeping, but look how even it's cooking these eggs. So we put the pan back on. Obviously, cool handle because the heat transfer doesn't go all the way up to the handle as it just stays in the pan, cool handle.\r\n\r\nAnd it's very, very safe for an extra burner at home. It's something that I would highly recommend because it's safe for the kids and energy efficient, 70 percent less energy. It's just perfect. So let's enjoy our eggs, and think about our Induction Professional Cook Top from Waring",
