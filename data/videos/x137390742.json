    "description": "http:\/\/www.oxo.com\/p-1220-22-lb-food-scale-with-pull-out-display.aspx\n\nOXO's user-friendly 22 lb Food Scale with Pull-Out Display is perfect for weighing all ingredients. Weigh items directly on the platform,on a plate or in a bowl, and pull the display away from the base to prevent shadowing from large plates and bowls. Accurately measure ingredients when cooking and baking or stick to a diet by weighing portions. An optional back light makes the display easier to read and a weight indicator shows the capacity left on the Scale before maximum capacity is reached. Press the zero button to offset the weight of a container or to set the weight back to zero so you can add additional ingredients. The display features large, easy-to-read numbers which measure in 1\/8-ounce (US) and 1-gram (metric) increments. The Scale also measures volume in mL and cups for water-based ingredients, and features a conversion chart that slides out from the body to measure other popular ingredients like flour and oil. The stainless steel platform can be removed for cleaning. The Scale has a 22-pound capacity and four AAA batteries are included.\n\nIf you have questions or comments on the Food Scales, reach out to us on Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OXO or Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/OXO",

    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. I'm Elizabeth from OXO. And today I'll be demonstrating the handy 22-Pound Food Scale. \n\nIn general, a food scale is a great tool to have on hand. They ensure accuracy in measurement and are also good for portion control. OXO's food scales have a host of thoughtful details that make them really simple to use. This 22-Pound Food Scale is great for large recipes and heavy items. \n\nThe display unit is the hub of this food scale. Turn it on using the power button. Wait for the scale to count down-- 3, 2, 1-- before you begin. The Zero button allows you to reset the scale between ingredients or to offset the weight of a plate or a bowl. This way, only the weight of the ingredient you're measuring is counted. \n\nSwitch between volume and weight by pressing the Unit button. The scale measures in pounds, kilograms, cups, and liters. This measuring cup icon appears and disappears to clearly indicate when you are moving from volume to weight. OXO's food scales measure accurately to 1\/8 of an ounce. \n\nFor better visibility, press the light bulb button to turn on the backlight. You can pull the entire display unit away from the scale while in use. This is great for when you're using large bowls or plates. The pull-out display is also helpful for weighing packages. There's an indicator that shows how much weight capacity has been used. \n\nIt comes with a useful conversion chart to help measure the volume of ingredients of different densities, like milk, oil, or eggs. When you're done, you can pull off the stainless steel plate and hand wash it. The food scale also comes in 11-pound and 5-pound versions. Any of OXO's food scales will be a welcome addition to your kitchen.",
