    "transcripts": "Open the click tight by pressing the dimple on the click tight dial and rotating the dial clockwise until it releases and lift to open. Reclaim a child seat and place rear facing in the vehicle seat. Place a vehicle lap belt into the rear facing belts slot and sure the vehicle belt is not twisted and buckle the seat belt. Remove slack then close the click tight until a click is heard. The click tight level must be in the horizontal position and ensure that the ball in the reclined indicator is within the allowable blue section for the size of the child. If more recline is needed the seat can be reinstalled with a rolled towel or pool noodle under the front of the seat. Check that the child seat cannot be moved front to back. Or side to side more than one inch at the belt path. Rear facing installations can be improved by the use of the tether see the rear facing tethering segment.",
