So for the zabaione we've got some simmering water here and we're just going to add some eggs, some egg yolks, and some sugar, and we're going to flavor that with a nice vanilla pod to give those eggs a lovely flavor. We're going to whisk them up. Okay so now we have our zabaione cooked and whisked up and now we need to add pureed strawberries. So in go the strawberries and we're just going to bend those to a fine puree. And the last thing we need to make-- some cream. We're just going to whisk up a little bit of whipping cream. Okay so we just whipped the butter and then we're ready to add the cream. Okay so now we have a lovely puree of straw berries which we can just fold in to our semifreddo mix. We can put this mixture into molds of glasses and then we're going to pop them in the freezer for about two or three hours. Okay so we've just taken our semifreddos from the freezer and I'm going to garnish it with some fresh strawberries. For some added texture as well, I've got some chocolate almond biscotti. The final touch is a little leaf of lemon verbena and there we have our strawberry semifreddo",
