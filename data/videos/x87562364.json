Enjoy the same antimicrobial protection that is built into Soniclear standard antimicrobial face and body brush now available in the lush cashmere brush head for sensitive skin.

Each brush bristle is perfectly built for tip prevent scratching and with gentle sonic motion won't pull and tug at the skin. Plus the lush cashmere brush head has an approximate six-month recommended replacement which is standard for all of Michael Todd's antimicrobial cleansing brush heads keep in mind with the lush chasmere brush head doesn't spin like a rotary flash instead the brush bristles move sonically back and forth like micro grooms you may not see the Bristol action, but you certainly will feel it working.
