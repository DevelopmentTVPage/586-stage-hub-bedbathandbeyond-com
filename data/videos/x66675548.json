And I watch the reruns. My party look tends to be wavy hair and red lips. That's my kinda thing I like to wear. Red lips and hair down and generally ridiculously huge heels that I torture around in. I like to be towering above my husband. Actually it was for the casting for this job. I forged my sisters hair colors and I slept with them and the next morning I looked like Shirley Temple it was awful. This was a curly nest at the top. So I used my hair straightener and I managed to fix it. My favorite make up tip is moisturizing your lips with loads and loads of lip balm on and then getting like a soft toothbrush and you'll end up with really soft lips afterwards. I'm really into sculpting at the moment. Basically highlight your cheek bones and then just kinda deep the tone dark tone in your skin to sculpt your face. Makes you look more skinny.",
