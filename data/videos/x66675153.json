We've got some nice chopped lamb. This is leg of lamb; it's nice and lean there's no fat. So we're going to add that into the machine. Ground cumin, some oregano, garlic cloves, also we have some mint leaves to go in there as well. Okay so we need to use salt and some paprika. It's amazing how quickly that minces the lamb. A little bit of cold water. I'm just going to dip my my hands in to mold our nice sausage shapes with our lamb mince. Fix it onto the skewer and we're ready to cook them. Here we've got a nice hot pan. We're going to add a little bit of olive oil and we're ready to add the koftes into this nice hot pan.\n\nSome diced cucumber. Some diced cucumber. Add that into the beaker, seasoning, we've got some yogurt, and we can start to mix this together. Okay when we have a nice puree like that, we're ready to add the fresh herbs. So here I've got some nice basil, some parsley, some chervil, and some chives. Okay so we have our herb cucumber yogurt. So we're going to leave those slightly pink in the middle. So first of all we're adding the cucumber and herb yogurt, the lamb koftes, and we're going to garnish with a little bit of fresh herbs, and some lime. Okay there you have it. Lamb koftes with cucumber herb yogurt. ",
