    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING] I spent a lot of time on my grandmother's farm. And, every single weekend, when we showed up, she would bake this unbelievable apple crisp pie for us. 20 years later, I come and work for a candle store, and one of the first fragrances I picked up was warm apple crisp. And I forgot what I was even at work. It brought me back 20 years before, when I was nine years old, in her kitchen, helping her cut up the apples. \n\nMy daughter went off to school and was missing her first Christmas. And I sent her scent plugs, and then car jars that were balsam and cedar for Christmas ornaments for a tree. And she felt like she was home. \n\nThe fragrance, for many of our guests, resonate for so many different memories. And why people are really connected to different fragrances is really amazing. \n\nIt's the emotional memory of the fragrances. Picking up the lid, and smelling the candle, and saying, oh my god this feels like the lilacs that were in my grandmother's garden, or, don't you remember when we did this? \n\nTo be transformed into a different time of your life through a fragrance is just unbelievable.",
