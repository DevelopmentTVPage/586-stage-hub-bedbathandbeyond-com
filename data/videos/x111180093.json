    "transcripts": "Well, salsa is definitely not French. But living in California for the last 20 years, it's a simple recipe. I love to make it at home. It goes really fast, it's colorful, it's fresh, and it goes really great with margaritas! The first ingredients are jalapeno pepper and cilantro leaves. I'm using a chopping blade in a food processor. I'm adding the pepper, and then the cilantro, and I will blend that for 20 seconds. So, the next ingredients is some lime juice and salt, and we'll add that to it. There we go, and pinch of salt. And I'm just going to pulse that 2 times. That's about it to mix it in. So now the next ingredients, I have 5 tomatoes that have been seeded and quartered and then one onion right here. I will add that to it, also. There we go. And then I will pulse that about 10-12 times, and that should be it. And now we're ready to serve. And now I'm just going to spoon it in, just like that. And here we go. It's very simple and it's so easy. I just love to serve it with some pita bread! Just dig it in and taste it. It's absolutely delicious!",
