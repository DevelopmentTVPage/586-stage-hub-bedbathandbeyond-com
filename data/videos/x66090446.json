It's advanced five sided design flows in radiance to ward the blade. Other blenders use the cumbersome tamper that can get nicked over time and contaminated with bacteria. The Blendtec Wildside plus jars speeds up protection so you can blend more in less time.\n\nWhile other blenders use thin sharp blades that break easily and cause thousands of injuries and safety recalls, Blendtec's uniquely blunt safety blades are completely safe to use and clean. They're made of cold forged steel and up to 80 percent thicker and ten times stronger than competitor's blades. Rather than cutting, they pulverize ingredients to a silky smooth consistency.\n\nOther blenders use plastic drive sockets that break under pressure and require frequent inspection and replacement. But Blendtec's hardened metal drive sockets are the strongest in the industry. They never need to be replaced; minimizing your downtime and cost of ownership.\n\nOur quiet ultra high speed motors are the most powerful in the industry. Other blenders have smaller motors that don't blend as well or hold up under hard everyday use. Blendtecs blend even the toughest ingredients like ice and frozen fruit quickly and easily.\n\n-My team is awesome!\n\nOur small touch interface is easy to use enabling one touch walk away blending. Other blenders still use old fashioned knob and dial controls that are clunky and can harbor unsafe mold and bacteria. Blendtecs are easy to use and easy to clean.\n\n-Voila!",
