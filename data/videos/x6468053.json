    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Nancy form Bed Bath & Beyond, and I'm here to tell you about the  Jelly Belly Electric Ice Shaver. It makes refreshing snow cones the whole family can enjoy\/ This ice shaver comes with a removable cup holder. So you can use snow cone cups or you own cups. It has an adjustable blade and a no mess drip tray. It comes with two ice molds, 20 snow cup cones, and straws. \n\nMaking homemade snow cones is so easy. Let me show you how to do it now. Place the bowl on top of the base and turn the knob to select either fine or coarse ice shavings. Put the ice in the bowl. Now put the motor on top of the ice and plug in the machine. Press the power button down while applying steady downward pressure. The motor will start and ice will begin to shave. Just take your hand off the power button to stop the machine. When your done shaving the ice, just add your favorite syrup and enjoy. Because the shaved ice is so fine , it immediately absorbs the flavor giving you a really intense taste all the way through. This electric ice shaver makes snow cones using either Jelly Belly's flavored syrups, soda, punch, or fruit juice.\n\nThe Jelly Belly Electric Ice Shaver is available online and at a Bed Bath and Beyond store near you.",
