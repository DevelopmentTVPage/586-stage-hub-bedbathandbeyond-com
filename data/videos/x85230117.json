    "transcripts": "Hi, my name is Stella and I'll be showing you how to use the smooth edge can opener. This can opener works like a charm. The soft cushion handles and over sized knob makes it easy to operate and it cuts on the side of the can instead of the top so there's no sharp edges on the can or the lid. So here's how it works. First, simply latch the opener on to the can and start tuning the non-slip over sized knob-- it only takes a moment. Anther great feature is that the stainless steel cutting wheel never touches the can's content so the opener stay clean and your food stays sanitary, Then I use the attached pliers to remove the lid. I can even place the lid directly back into the can if I haven't used the entire amount. I love the Smooth Edge Can Opener. It's really effortless and I'm sure you'll agree.",
