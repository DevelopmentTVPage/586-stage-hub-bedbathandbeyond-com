Designed to deliver a bright rich flavor like you get in the coffee shop. Making siphon brew coffee by hand is a complicated process requiring a open flame and frequent temperature adjustments. But with the KitchenAid siphon brewer you can do it with the convince of a home brewing system it works with vacuum technology that fully immerses the coffee grounds and water to create a more complex flavor profile. Have it straight or enhance it's high in flavor with the top shelf spirit. I like a little Kentucky bourbon in mind. I'm Tim Laid in the chef's corner with KitchenAid.",
