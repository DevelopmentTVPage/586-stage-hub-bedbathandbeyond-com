    "transcripts": "This time in the chef's corner with KitchenAid we catch up with Chef Josh Moore at Louisville, Volare Restaurant. Making one of his most popular small plates. Seared scallops topped with crispy prosciutto, served over sweet pea puree. Our KitchenAid immersion blender makes easy work of the sweet pea puree. This is going to make a very smooth sauce. This sauce makes the dish and it's easy to make yourself with some simple ingredients and the KitchenAid pro line series hand blender. Varies are s.p. it's all about having the right tools when you're at home cooking. Sweet peas, heavy cream, salt and pepper, gonna bring that to a boil on the stove and then we're going to puree it with our KitchenAid immersion blender. The beauty about this KitchenAid immersion blender is that it's cordless so we can take it anywhere in the kitchen without having to run an extension cord. The lithium battery gives you consistent power and optimal run time so you can cook like a pro. It's lightweight, easy to handle and extremely versatile with a wide array of attachments to make a range of cooking tasks easy. I'm Tim Laird in the chef's corner with KitchenAid.",
