    "transcripts": "The Napoleon Triumph Series of grills offers numerous features to turn anyone into a backyard grill master. With up to 5 burners and 55,700 BTU\u2019s the Triumph series of grills allows you to cook your meals to perfection. The Triumph models are ideal for small spaces, as the side shelves fold to make storage more convenient between meals. The JETFIRE Ignition promises a quick and easy start up every time, and the ACCU-PROBE temperature gauge keeps a precise watch on your grill. The range side burner allows you to prepare a complete meal right on your grill, allowing you to spend more time outside rather than doing the traditional dance of running between the kitchen and grill to keep an eye on everything at once. The porcelainized Cast Iron WAVE cooking grids allow you to produce restaurant quality meals easily, as they retain the heat and are simple to maintain. An integrated bottle opener adds the final touch for entertaining. The Triumph Series offers three models, the T325, T410 and T495 ranging from three to five burners and larger cooking areas, allowing you to select the model that suits your needs. Aside from all of the features that these grills offer, here are several options that can turn your grill into a truly gourmet kitchen. Accessories including the smoker tube, tomato\/ pepper roast rack and the gourmet burger press kit all allow you to take your grilling to the next level, and work perfectly with the Triumph series of grills. Enjoy your Triumph and get grilling.",
