    "transcripts": "The time in the chef's corner with KitchenAid. We catch up with Chef Josh Moore at Louisville, Volare Restaurant. Making fresh pasta from scratch. He uses his KitcheAid artisan design series stand mixer to knead  the dough and then he'll make fettuccine using his KitchenAid pasta attachments. The roller helps him guide sheets of just made dough to whatever thickness he likes. You could leave it in sheets for lasagna, make squares for ravioli or cut it into noodles of any thickness you want. There's actually an attachment that will make those cuts perfectly uniform from spaghetti to fettuccine. Fresh pasta is a world apart from the dry kind and you can make it yourself with a few simple ingredients and your KitchenAid stand mixer and pasta attachments. I'm Tim Laird in the chef's corner with KitchenAid.",
