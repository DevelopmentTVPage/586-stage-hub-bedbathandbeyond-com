Good grip, solid, very sharp, let the knife do the work. Get a nice flat surface. Just make a small incision, a little tap, and we're gonna rock it back and forth. What do we've got? We some seeds, so we need to take care of these. Let's break it down into quarters. Always keep it on a nice flat side. Get a good grip once again. We're going to go in with the grooves. Pretty simple. Now, of course we can keep this as is stuff it as this, but let's make some slices to make some nice smaller portions. So we're just going to go right across some nice slices. Knife point to where you want to cut and go right down in with your knife. So I got some nice slices for roasting and quarters.",
