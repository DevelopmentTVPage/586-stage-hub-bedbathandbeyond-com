    "transcripts": "The number one reason people buy the big easy is to cook a turkey. Now we happen to have a ten pound bird in the basket today. You can cook up to a sixteen pound bird and you can use rub on it or put an aromatic stuffing like I like to use. The most important thing, get that thermometer in there just right because you're gonna want to measure temperature not time when you're cooking in the big easy. You got the legs down, the breast up, drop it in the basket put it in the cooking chamber. There is no pre heating necessary. Turn your gas on and turn it until a light, it's lit. Sit back and relax and let the big easy do it's work. There is a wire mesh lid that is provided. You can place it on there if you think debris or material are going to fall in but it's not  important. People always ask me \"how long to I cook it\" and the answer is until it's done. Now we're talking turkey here so we're gonna want 165 internal temperature. It's cooked long enough. I see it's between 160 and 165. after I take it out it's going to continue to cook just a bit so I turn everything off. I'm going to use my hook because it's hot in here but remember there's no oil that's going to spill. I am pulling it out of 100 percent infrared cooking chamber and I'm just going to set it down. Let it cool a little bit that I can remove it from the cooking chamber and we're good to go.",
