    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Jessica for campus and beyond from Bed Bath and Beyond. And I'm Nicole. I'm incoming freshman and Jess has been helping me set up my dorm room. Hey Nicole are you ready to start studying? Oh yeah I guess that's one of the things you're supposed to do around here. Yeah and if you want to make it a more pleasant experience you have to make your work space work for you. And I see you got the desk chair and it's built for working in a desk so your back will thank you for it. \n\nAnd a lot of people forget to get a desk lamp but I see you have one of those too and you'll be able to see everything on your desk. Yeah that's gonna be great for when I do manicures at my desk right? Well yeah that too. And it's a good idea that you thought of bringing a book case because they don't always provide that. \n\nYeah I saw my book list and I definitely need the book case. And I'm thinking you're probably going to do your a lot of your homework right on your bed. Yeah that's what I'm thinking so I got this thing. It gives me light where ever I need it. And I got this laptop cooling pad which keeps my laptop from getting too hot and my thighs. Oh and this lamp here I bought that too. I like it so much better than the overhead lights in the room. Yes, It's nice to have a floor lamp too you don't want to be squinting at your text book or your manicure. Hmm now that you mention it ",
