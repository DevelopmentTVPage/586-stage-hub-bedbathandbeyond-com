    "transcripts": "Hi, Chef Mike here with Wusthof-Trident of America. And today, I'm going to talk about my absolute favorite knife, the Super Slicer. The Super Slicer is a single-bevel reverse scallop knife. It's a great slicing knife. That single bevel allows you to get really, really thin slices, or you can also do really thick slices. \n\nNow, it's great for melons. It's great for cabbage. Great for large tomatoes. Also really good for cooked meats, for raw meats. And it's absolutely my favorite knife for skinning salmon. \n\nNow, when you skin the salmon, you're just going to get under the flesh here. Once you get it here, you're going to pull back. We're going to use a back-and-forth motion. I'm going to pull with my left hand, go through. And this is why this is a favorite knife of chefs all over. \n\nYou can see this. It actually separates the flesh from the skin, does a great job on that. This is the reverse scallop Super Slicer single-bevel knife. Great for planing off thin or thick cuts.",
