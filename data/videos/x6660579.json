    "transcripts": "Oven roasted garlic is a must-know recipe for every cook. Start by removing some of the excess paper from a head of garlic. Slice about 3\/4 of an inch off the top, exposing the bulbs. Place on a sheet of foil. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, and wrap tightly. Bake in the oven at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes. \n\nThen remove, let cool, open, and, then, cue the angels. \n\n[ANGELIC SINGING] \n\nThe sharp flavor has completely mellowed, the cloves have softened, and it's wonderfully delicious. You can mix with some mayo for a great addition to any sandwich, spread it as the base on a flat bread for a full-flavor snack, or simply spoon some on crusty bread for a wonderful bite. And I mean wonderful.",
