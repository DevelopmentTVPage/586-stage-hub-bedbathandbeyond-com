    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Alonna from OXO and today I'll be demonstrating our adjustable measuring cups. This measuring cup is particularly useful for measuring sticky ingredients like shortening but is also helpful for liquid or dry ingredients. An internal track and wide comfortable turning knob, allow the measuring cup to adjust smoothly. Let me show you just how easy it is to use. To fill, just find your desired measurement marking on the appropriate side of the cup. Twist the knob to the left until the top of the plunger is aligned with the measurement marking, fill the measuring cup and scrape off the excess if you're measuring a dry or solid ingredient. Then, simply twist the turning knob to push out the ingredients. If you are measuring a liquid ingredient, make sure to fill to the liquid fill line. The adjustable measuring cup is bpa free and dishwasher safe. It's available in a 2 cup, a 1 cup, and a mini measuring cup size.",
