For starters, how about a breakfast bagel. Just beat an egg in a small greased custard cup and microwave it along with some microwaved bacon for about 45 seconds. Then, put the egg on a bagel top with cheese, the bacon, and booyah.  A great start to the day in about a minute. Or how about poking some holes in a potato and microwaving it 3-4 minutes aside then open it up, add some microwave chili, a little sour cream, and some cheese-- beautiful. And while we probably all agree that the microwave is ideal for pop corn, it doesn't have to be served the same way all the time. So how about making a butter and salted maple version or buffalo sauce and honey, or even mixed herb & Parmesan.  It's all simple, quick, and delicious and you can do all this stuff you just have to want to.",
