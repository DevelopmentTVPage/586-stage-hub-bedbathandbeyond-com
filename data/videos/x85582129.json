    "transcripts": "My name is Alison and this is baby Bella she is almost a year, we've been using the original Dr. Brown's bottle said she was born and then recently switched over to the Dr. Brown's options bottle. My name is Micah this is Elijah and his seven weeks old today, I have tried other bottles and he would not take them and then when I use the Dr. Brown's bottle he took them right away it was really easy no fuss and he was just really great with them. I'm Angie and this is six month old Charlie and we've been using the Dr. Brown's bottle since he was four weeks old, now that Charlie six months old I've noticed that he doesn't have as many of the stomach troubles as he did when he was first born. I'm excited to use the new options bottle it's great that I can use it with or without the vent and it makes it perfect for traveling over to grandma's or to the sitter's house. When I first heard about the options bottle I was very excited because now that Stella is getting closer to a year old she doesn't always need the internal vent system, she seems to do well without it. I can use it now while he's young with the vent inside of it and once he gets older and he starts growing and getting bigger I have the option to take it out. I'm confident with the Dr. Brown's bottle that Charlie is getting the nutrients that he needs to be healthy and happy.",
