To begin open package contents in group like parts, turn the cart on its side and slide the axle through the openings in the bottom of the cart like this. Notice that the cotter clips have bumps in them and the cotter pins are straight, slip a cotter clip into the holes on either side of the axle like so. Take notice that the cotter clips are outside of the frame tubing. On one side of the axle slip on a washer, a spring and another washer like so, now push a wheel onto the axle while holding the wheel in place put a hop cap on the end of the axle making sure that the hole in the hub cap for the cotter pin lines up with the hole in the axle. Once the holes are lined up insert a cotter pin all the way through make sure you push the pin in as far as it will go now lay the unit on its side and using pliers open the ends of the cotter pin by bending the ends in opposite directions like so to lock the wheel in place. Now repeat for the other wheel. Whooh, the cart is made to fold and can be latched in a closed position for convenient storage. The road with your multi-purpose wheeled cart and it saved you money now you can hit the road with your multi-purpose wheeled cart. At honey can do we don't believe you have to go broke to have a beautiful well-organized home and assembly should be easy to do.",
