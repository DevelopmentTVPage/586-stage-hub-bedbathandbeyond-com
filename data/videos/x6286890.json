    "transcripts": "In countries like America the recommended daily allowance is five servings of fruit and vegetables per day. In other countries like Japan it's up to 17 servings a day. Ideally you should aim for at least nine servings and remember that potatoes don't count. So if you're not a fan of eating your salads, get your daily dose with this juice recipe. It's two leaves of kale which is a powerhouse of nutrients that's a great base for most green drinks. Two leaves of swiss chard  and there are many varieties so I feel free to experiment. One cup of spinach that actually contains twice as much iron as other greens. One large colin green leaf which adds a bit of spiciness. Two stalks of celery high in water content and vitamin A. One small cucumber a fantastic source of potassium and magnesium. One pear which balances out the sweet tard of this combinations and buy them a little firmer as you get more juice. One lemon and a powerful antioxidant and helps support the body against infections and inflammation. One handful of parsley and this herb really brings out the flavors of the other ingredients. Use the stem as most chefs know most of the flavor is in the stem not the leaves themselves. Instead of having to eat your way through pounds of produce. Juicing provides the most efficient way to give you an instant hit of your daily nutrient needs but in a glass. Cheers to your RDA.",
