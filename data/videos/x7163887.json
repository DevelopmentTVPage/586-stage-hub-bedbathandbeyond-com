    "transcripts": "Traditional gas barbecues work like this: the gas burner heats the air and it's the hot air that actually cooks the food. But unfortunately this same hot air also dries the food. You see, all foods have a moisture barrier. The hot-air damages it so the natural juices quickly evaporate and the food becomes more and more dry and often with less flavor. But Char-Broil Tru infrared grills cooks in a completely different way. Let's see how it works. In Tru-Infrared grills, the gas burner keeps a special emitter which absorbs energy and heat. Instead of hot air, this emitter re-radiates intense infrared heat directly to the food. Since infrared heat does not affect the moisture barrier, it remains intact so the juices remain trapped inside and Tru infrared grilled foods are much juicier and full of natural flavor. Char-Broil Tru infrared grills also have other advantages over traditional gas grills. They cook fast and use less gas, they deliver consistent even heating across the entire surface of the grill. You can slow roast on low or sear the thickest steaks on high\u2019. Char-Broil Tru infrared grills prevent flare-ups. Try Char-Broil tru-infrared for yourself the only gas grill to deliver the juicy taste of charcoal grill foods. Char-Broil Tru infrared.",
