I've just set the bowl over the water. There are eggs, brown sugar, and we're going to cream that together. Okay so we just need to bring that together a little bit and then we're ready to add some chopped almonds, flour, some baking powder, and some dark cocoa. And the last ingredient that we're going to add is a little bit of grated orange zest. So we will give that another mix. See with the cordless it give you so much freedom to move around the kitchen. Okay so we're going to add melted chocolate to the mixture and some orange juice. Final mix and the brownie is ready to go in the oven. Okay so I prepared a baking dish and I just lightly buttered it and we're ready to pour the brownie mixture into the dish and we're going to bake that in the oven for about 30 minutes with 190 degrees. Okay there it is finished all simple chocolate brownie.",
