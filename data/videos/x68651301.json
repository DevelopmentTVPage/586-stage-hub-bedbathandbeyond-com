The Braun series 9 has a fully flexible shaving system which adapts to every contour of my face. Even problem areas such as the chin, neck or jawline are easy to shave. The easy pop up long hair trimmer gives me perfect precision on my side burns. I can groom with foam or gel or during a refreshing shower, that's no problem with Braun series 9. Ultimate performance for perfectly smooth skin. The best way to clean my shaver is with Braun cleaner charge station without one I can clean my Braun shaver with a brush or under hot running water. I change the cutting system cassette about every 18 months and change the cleaning center refill about once a month or when the indicator blinks red. To maintain 100 percent of my shavers performance.",
