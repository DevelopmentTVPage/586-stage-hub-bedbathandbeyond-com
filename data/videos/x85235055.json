No other compensation was provided. \n\nSometimes there's little fishes like this. They go and sometimes water comes out. And sometimes this goes with water really slow. And the boat comes one and off. And when you put two things in it, wow it comes back in. This is called a funnel and it comes off.  Looks round inside. And watch this is how the water goes through it. See? This is how it goes. There's a little hole under there so the water goes on this and then  goes down the slide and into the water pit-- that's how it works! You need holes to put water and that's how you do it. \n\nThanks!\n\nYou're Welcome",
