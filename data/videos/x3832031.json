A dirty filter or a clog. Let's first check the filter. Remove your dirt cup, twist off the top, and remove the filter like this. If you haven't cleaned it recently, you should rinse t under the sink for about two minutes. Let it stand and dry fro 24 hours. Now let's check fora clog. I have a neat trick. Remove the hose here, take a coin and drop it through. If it doesn't come out the other end easily, there may be a clog. Work it out of the hose, but do not use any sharp items to do so. I hope that helps.",
