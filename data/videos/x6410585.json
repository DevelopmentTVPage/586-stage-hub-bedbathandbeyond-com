    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Mary Rogers, director of marketing communications for Cuisinart. This is the Cuisinart Pure Indulgence two quart frozen yogurt and ice cream maker. This product is a lot of fun to use. It's really easy to operate. \n\nFirst you need to put your freezer bowl in the freezer. We recommend overnight at zero degrees. And you put it right inside, you put your ingredients in here, you add your ice cream dasher, and this is what turns the ice cream as it freezes. \n\nYou put your lid on, and you'll notice the lid has a little hole in it right here, where as your ice cream's almost finished you can add in small pieces of fruit or chocolate chips or even a couple of small pieces of nuts. And after you get all your ingredients in, you just turn it on. \n\nIt's beautifully designed. It has a stainless steel housing. And guess what? In 25 minutes you're going to have fresh, flavorful, ice cream or frozen yogurt right at home.",
