    "description": "AutoClean\u2122 Setting On The Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Big Easy 2-in-1 Electric Smoker & Roaster\n\nAfter removing your food return the cooking basket, warming basket, and half racks to The Big Easy. Close the lid, and press the (+) Temperature Control Button until the letter (C) is displayed on the Power Level Display. This will activate the AutoClean\u2122 cycle. \n\nAutoClean\u2122 is a high-heat cycle that will burn-off most remaining food debris and conveniently power-off The Big Easy after 30-minutes. After the cooking accessories have cooled, they will be ready for brushing with a standard grill brush -- similar to brushing the cooking grates of an outdoor barbeque grill. Remove any remaining food debris from the bottom of the cooking chamber and empty the grease tray once the unit has cooled down. \n\nIf preferred, the cooking accessories can be cleaned in a dishwasher or washed with soap and water instead of being left inside the cooking chamber while running the AutoClean\u2122 cycle.",
