    "transcripts": "So before we developed the juice fountain. The issues that needed to be solved were ease of use really about ease of use of speed of use and cleaning. So when we solved the, the cutting up  issue by creating a wide feed tube that you could feed a whole apple into it without needing to cut it up. And by creating a system where the the juicing disk is central and runs at very high speed. Improving the efficiency of that side with a separable container that could be removed and empty during the process and minimizing the number of components to make it needed to be cleaned. The juice fountain really brought back a large step forwards in the process of juicing we've seen that globally now with the success of our products and it's a growth in the number of users using the juicer for juicing.",
