Route the end of the harness through the opening on the inside of the metal bar behind the anchor to the bottom of the seating area. Wrap the end of the harness around to the outside of the bar and hook the harness loop to the anchor. Ensure that it is securely connected to the anchor inside the hook. The harness may appear loose. But it is secure as long as it is captured within the anchor hook. Repeat on the other side.",
