    "transcripts": "Introducing the breville juice and blend. The perfect tool to make real fruit smoothies. Blenders and juicers serve two different functions. Harbor fruits and vegetables are best juiced where is softer fruits and ice are best blended . Leave it to the designers of breville to figure out how to combine the two into one powerful appliance with a common base. Introducing the breville juice and blend. This is the perfect tool to make any fruit smoothies packed with nutrients . Really the combinations are limited by your own taste . Let's look at the juicing head first . Make sure the juice extractor top this correctly in place. Filter basket in. This safety locking arm should be in a vertical position. I like to line my soap container in a produce bag for quick clean-up and the juicer jug under the spout. The 5 variable speeds allow you to customize extraction depending on you're juicing . And there is a handy guide in the inside of the pulp container to help you determine your speed. Juice citrus or even melons or kiwis , you'll want to take the skin off due to its bitter flavor. But for these oranges it's okay to keep some of the white pit is packed with nutrients. On setting 1 juicing oranges but first give it a moment to speed up before putting any fruit down the chute . Look how wonderfully frosting orange juice can be period then turn the dial up to 5 to choose a wedge of pineapple. Breville juicers are so powerful that you can actually keep the right on. And this is good because all those vital nutrients are right next to the surface of the pineapple skin . It's sometimes a good idea to add a slice of lemon or lime 20 combination of fruit and vegetables . This stops the browning 4 from oxidization and evens out any concoction . Now place the blender jar on top . The handle of the jug should .2 The left . So now you erase the locking arm into the tube . And once it's clicked into place, it's ready to go . Now that's make a smoothie. When making a smoothie always add liquid ingredients before solid ones . So add to fresh juice, milk , mango, banana comma and ice end selected smoothie function . You can see the mixture suspended in air . This is aerating the mixture naturally so you don't need to add the extra calories to thicken it like yogurt or honey. And to ensure that it is not over processed, it has an automatic auto shut-off function after 60 seconds . You can't get much better than the real fruit juice smoothie from the breville juice and blend. The juice and blend brought to you by the foodthinkers at breville.",
