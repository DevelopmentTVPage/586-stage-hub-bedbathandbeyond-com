Move the base up or down until the red marker is visible between the two lines on the recline angle indicators while on the vehicle seat. Route the vehicle belt through the belt guides. Ensure that the vehicle's seat belt is not twisted and buckle the vehicle belt. Press the base firmly into the vehicle seat while removing all slack, first from the lap portion and then from the shoulder portion of the vehicle seat belt. Hold the vehicle's shoulder belt tightly and slide firmly under the lock off on the side of the base opposite the buckle. Check that the vehicle belt is tight and that the base is secure. The base is secure when it moves less than one inch front to back or side to side at the vehicle belt path. Check that the recline angle is correct and confirm that the red marker is visible between the two lines on the recline angle indicators. Place the infant car seat into the base and press down until a click is heard. Pull up on the infant car seat to verify attachment. To remove the infant car seat pull and hold the release lever on the back of the infant car seat. Lift the infant car seat up from the base.",
