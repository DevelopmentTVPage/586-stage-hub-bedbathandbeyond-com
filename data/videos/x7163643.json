I am just Michael Anthony welcome to Gramercy Tavern we're excited to show you a dish that we do here in the restaurant in all clad nonstick so let's take a look at the kitchen. My thought is that we can make it for different frittatas because there's no better example of working on a non stick because frittata . you bake the thing in there you flip it over. It either comes out or it doesn\u2019t. Something normal when it starts to Bubble like that it's done and in this case this is cooking so softly 1 because the plan itself holds the heat and that is what's remarkable about this pan. Which you often find when you buy a lesser quality non-stick pan. Even the sides can tell you why and so you end up having a burnt on the sides and you can\u2019t have this because it doesn\u2019t have the same even heat. The pans are things that are not supposed to change everything else here changes on a daily basis everything here should stay consistent  and I would say that is a great selling point for the pans. Are you filming this because this is like the most incredible part. I\u2019m guessing every chef answered the way we did and that we kind of embarrassed embarrassed said \u201cwell I think we probably end up using metal spatulas in the non stick pan which you know is a huge No-No but every restaurant is going to do that . I guess the moment of truth becomes whether or not t it's stuck. she just came out perfectly",
