    "transcripts": "This is the Breville Ikon removable plate Grill and what makes this unique is the 6 adjustable height settings on the side. The Sydney design team designed it so you can cook your delicate fish or warm up your pizza at home. It's also got the diecast arm so it's never going to be hot to touch. And it's got the drip tray which is actually engineered into the unit so it doesn't have that huge funky drip tray that falls off like other girls. And it's got the adjustable temperature control from 350 to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. So by using that on a flat plate you can make breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert all on the one unit. I've made some steak here for you today. Look at that. Another great feature is the nonstick removable plates so all you need to do is wipe it down and then just wipe out the juices and then click it out and pop it in the dishwasher, so easy. Another great Innovation by Breville.",
