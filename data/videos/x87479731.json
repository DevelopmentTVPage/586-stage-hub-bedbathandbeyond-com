    "transcripts": "Distracting noises, racing minds, and a life full of phones and computers can make it difficult to sleep at night and focus during the day. In fact, two out of three Americans suffer from a lack of quality sleep. If you're tired of waking up on the wrong side of the bed, relax you mind and body with the Zenergy collection with iHome. These bluetooth speakers are designed with light and sound therapy to realign your circadian rhythm to your sleep and wake schedule. Choose between therapeutic sounds of white, digital recordings of natural environments or engineer tones that mimic meditative brainwaves to experience a more focused and peaceful state of mind. Zenergy light therapy uses soothing red and orange tone hues to increase melatonin and encourage sleep at night while stimulating blue toned and multicolored themes help you wake up and stay energized throughout the day. The Zynergy line is endorsed by Dr. Michael Bruce. Throughout the day, your body is exposed to different wavelengths of light that help maintain your natural sleep wake schedule, but if you have a busy day, you can actually deprive yourself of this event. The Zynergy collection simulates these light wavelengths with soothing sounds to trigger subtle biological responses that can improve your overall sleep, energy, and mood. I'm going to recommending this to my family to my friends and especially to my patients. With multiple light and therapy modes, the Zynergy collection is for all ages and features models for both home and travel. Plus, use the convenient Zynergy app to customize your settings and daily schedules. Get the good night sleep you deserve with the Zynergy collection from iHome. Sleep restfully, wake energized, Zynergy.",
