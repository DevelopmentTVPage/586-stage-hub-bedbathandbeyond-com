Profiteroles are made with P\u00e2te \u00c0 Choux, eclairs are made with P\u00e2te \u00c0 Choux, it's a very easy recipe to make it begins with water, butter and salt. Reheat that up in our sauce pot until it just begins to simmer and then we're going to add our flour to it and we don't want to let it simmer too long cause the water will evaporate and of course will change the recipe texture so we want to make sure that as soon as the butter is melted and just starts to simmer you add your flour and then you're going to mix that until the flour and water and butter come together and start to release from the pans. As your mixing you'll start to feel it ball together and start to release from the pan. Once that happens you can turn the fire off in the same sauce pot we are going to start adding eggs whole eggs one by one. Once all the eggs are incorporated well you want to really get ambitious and aggressive with it and mix that really till it gets very smooth cream texture and then we're going put it in pastry bag and in this case we are going to make a little profiterole or a little cream puffs and we can fill those with ice cream, can fill those with pastry cream, we can also freeze it. You can make your eclairs or your little goutier and pop them in the freezer and then you have guest you can just throw them in the oven. Really great great recipe .",
