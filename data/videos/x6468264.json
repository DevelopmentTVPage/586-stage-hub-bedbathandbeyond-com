    "transcripts": "We send our kids away to college to learn all sorts of things with the exception of one area-- cooking. But is it really our fault? Because many of the dorms won't allow them to cook on anything anyways, but that's okay. Here are three recipes they could make without any cooking equipment. The first I call the scissored salad. Aptly named because you simply prepare the salad using regular scissors instead of a knife. I think it's kind of genius. How about a BBQ chicken sandwich made by combining shredded deli roasted chicken with BBQ sauce all in a bun with potato chips for crunch of course. Or a Mediterranean veggie wrap. With hummus, some chopped romaine, jarred red peppers, feta  cheese, and all rolled in one big wrap. It's also doable. Be sure to check out our college  food part 2. We step it up a bit. What you can make with just a microwave. We think you're gonna like it.",
