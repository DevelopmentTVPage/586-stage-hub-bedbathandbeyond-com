We have had a lot of questions, and this actually can cause you quite a bit a heartache, if not done properly. Personally, I can think of some pretty bad examples of putting a pizza in the oven and the dough sticking to the peel and all the toppings going in the oven. And so we're going to talk a little bit about the different products that you can use. Me personally, I just prefer flour. If you put flour on that's a lot finer and you don't have to use quite as much and for me personally that's the one I prefer. I know a lot of people have used this as well is Semolina flour and if you go ahead and put that on you can see it's a lot more course and really gives you a nice nice surface for your pizza to come off on. If you're having problems with your pizza sticking to your peels, I probably suggest going to a Semolina flour. And last but not least-- corn mill. Corn mill is a lot courser than the other three and gives you a lot more distinct flavor in your oven. So it's more of a personal preference but just make sure that you do get it on there. But if you put to much , then your definitely going to be able to tell in the finished product, so be careful. Get enough on there to cover your peel, but not so much that it's gonna cake onto to your final product. ",
