    "transcripts": "The best way to create a glam look is to go for a classic smoky eye. And to create a smokey eye I specially love Nourishing Longer Wear eye shadow in Smoky Steel.The perfect smoky eye is  all about concentrating your darkest color along your lash line and into your crease. To make your brow bones pop, very lightly add a touch of highlighter to the lightest point of your brow bone. Use the light silver all over the eye lid and blend it up to the crease. Using an angled brush, apply the black shadow along your lower lash line and then blend the graphite and black together. For some extra dram, line your upper and lower lash lines with the black eyeliner. And then to finish off your look, coat your eyelashes with a black mascara. And there you have it, the perfect smoky eye. Because you never know when you'll be locking eyes with someone.",
