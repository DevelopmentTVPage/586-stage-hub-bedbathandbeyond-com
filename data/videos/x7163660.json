    "description": "Deep-Frying consists of submerging uncooked or coated food in a large quantity of hot oil (170 to 180\u00b0C) so that it cooks to a crispy golden brown.     \n                                   \n For the shrimp tempura recipe, dip the shrimps' tails into a batter made up of flour, corn starch and ice water Then, carefully drop them one by one into the boiling oil. Shake the fry basket gently in order to keep the shrimp from sticking to the bottom. After cooking for 4 to 5 minutes, raise the fry basket out of the oil, to drain off the excess of oil and dry the shrimp on a paper towel. The shrimps' tails are tasty and tender.",

    "transcripts": "Frying is a cooking technique that consists in cooking food in open frying pan with a small quantity of fat or oil. In order to achieve perfect cooking results, make sure to preheat your frying pan. It should be hot without too much smoke. Add enough butter to sufficiently cook and base your steak. Then add the stake and allow it to brown gently without moving it. Turn the steak over and baste it regularly until the desired degree of cooking is achieved seared, rare, medium or well done about three to 10 minutes depending on thickness. Season to taste when the stake is close to being done. The all-clad copper core frying pan is ideally designed to give you excellent results thanks to its ability to distribute heat effectively the meat is seared quickly in order to retain its flavor and tenderness. You can make your steak even more delicious and serve it with a creamy and spicy pepper sauce.",
