They just need to be roughly chopped. So in a warm pan here we're just going to add the olive oil straight in with the onions. Okay so here I have carrots so we need to chop these. Already we have these lovely combinations of flavors. So lemon grass is a lovely fragrant herb and it's going to give it a nice zingy combination. The other ingredient that we're going to add now is a little curry powder. I'll just warm this chick stock up so we can add a couple of labor force. Okay so we have the soup that's been cooking for about 15 minutes now so the carrots are just nicely cooked. So now we're ready to add some coconut milk and some lime juice. Put the juice of half a lime and a little bit of pepper and salt and we're going to finish with some chopped coriander. Oaky so now we have the soup finished and we're ready to blend it so we can brig over the cordless to the pan and even while it's on the heat we can blend this to a nice creamy emulsified soup. Okay we'll bring the soup to a lovely fine puree and with the multi-quick seven cordless it gives you a lot more freedom to move around the kitchen. So we can pour the soup into our bowl, chopped coriander, and a tiny bit of coconut milk. And there we have a nice simple snack and fresh tasting soup of carrot lemon grass and coriander.",
