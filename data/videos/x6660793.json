Oh sure, call it obvious, but it's my day and I want what I want. \n\nSo start by putting the following in a small pot-- Butter, chopped fresh thyme, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, a little salt, and lemon juice. Melt over low heat and set aside. \n\nUsing scissors, cut right up the middle of the lobster shell towards the tail, but don't cut through the tail. Now using the cut as your guide, take a knife and cut down through the meat, but not through the bottom shell. Pull the shell sides apart to expose the meat and brush well with the butter mixture. \n\nRub steak with a little olive oil. Season with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. And cook until beautifully done on both sides. Remove to a plate, cover with foil, and let rest about 10 minutes. \n\nNow it's time for the lobster. Put it open side down on a medium hot grill for about five minutes. Then turn over and cook another three to four minutes or until done, of course basting with the butter while it cooks. Then just remove from the shell, plate with the steak, drizzle with a little of the lobster butter, and wish Dad a Happy Father's Day. And in this case, that would be me. To all the dads out there. I wish you a happy and a delicious Father's Day.",
