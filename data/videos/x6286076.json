So good that even people who don't like sprouts fall in love with these. Everybody loves these because they're sweet, and there salty,  they're crunchy. They're easy to make with a KitchenAid stand mixer. You just need red onions, olive oi,l red wine vinegar, whole grain mustard, capers and an egg yolk. We start off by taking an egg yolk in our KitchenAid mixer here, couple ounces of our red wine vinegar then I heaping tablespoon of that whole grain mustard. The important part is mixing this on a high speed and drizzling the oil in real slow because we want to get an opportunity for the dressing to bind together here. And we just want to things stream here. Once it's emulsified in the KitchenAid chef John adds capers and Julienne red onion. So is taking our lightly fry brussels sprouts that we have in a bowl here we're going to generously coat them with our delicious red wine and Dijon vinaigrette. There's our beautiful brussels sprout dish everybody comes to Varanese to try. With a few simple ingredients and a KitchenAid mixer and we're ready to eat.",
