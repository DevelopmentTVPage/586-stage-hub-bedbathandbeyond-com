Okay, I'll show you again. Still didn't get it? Okay fine, here's how you make them. In a large bowl add shredded, coked chicken,  diced green chilies, green salsa, and a minced chipotle pepper - stir well to combine. Pour about a cup of whipping cream in the bottom of a casserole dish. Dip a flour tortilla in a chicken broth to soften, add some of the chicken mixture, roll up and place seam side down in the dish and continue until they're all done. Add shredded Monterrey jack cheese, and top with more cream. Bake in a 350 F oven until brown, bubbly and gorgeous and serve with dices green onions. With enchiladas this good I'll take all the icky weather you've got - Okay, maybe not all of it. ",
