    "transcripts": "Here we have a beautiful sockeye salmon that we're going to cut into steaks and to fillet. And you're going to remove the head by cutting behind the fin and cutting through the spine. I've chosen a chefs knife to do this. It's a heavy knife sharp. So for cutting steaks you want to just make a pretty assertive cut down through the spine. The next thing I am going to do is to fillet the fish here. Open it up setting the knife at the heel on top of the backbone. Inserting into the bone and then you're going to drag the knife down on the backbone one motion bearing it leaving a nice clean fillet. Once we have our fillet of the frame, we're going to take and clean it up a bit inserting the knife under the rib cage bones , we're going to make a nice draw cut sliding the knife and taking the knife at the base here. Sliding it down taking the belly off. Then we're gonna cut into portions just drawing the knife one slice. Having a very sharp knife is great. So here we have our finished salmon fillets. One portioned ready to cook and two steaks ready to hit the grill. ",
