    "transcripts": "The key to getting a subtle no make up look is to use a foundation with light coverage and use natural colors on your lips and eyes. Start with a light foundation. I'm using Neutrogena liquid skin liquid make up. Now I'm just going to apply the Neutrogena highlight powder all over my face focusing more on my cheek bone area and the creases of my eyes. I'm going to be using the nourishing  long wear eye shadow in classic nude. First I'm going to apply the peach color all over my eye lid. Then using the taupe shade, I'm going to apply this right into the crease and lastly, using the eggshell nude color, I'm going to highlight right underneath my brows. As a from of eye liner, I'll be using the espresso brown color on my upper lash line. To finish the look I'll use the moisture smooth color stick and fresh papaya. Then I'm just going to wipe off any excess with my fingertip. And there you have it; a natural look for those make up kind of days.",
