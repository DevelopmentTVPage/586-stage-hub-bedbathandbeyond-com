    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Adrinna from OXO and today I'll be demonstrating how he our fats separator. This b.p.a. free tool separates unwanted fat from all the flavorful juices making any great gravier stock delicious and healthier. The unique stopper keeps fat from entering the spout. I'll show you how that works in a bit. To use simply pour the stock or pan juices into the fat separator. Let the juices settle so that the fact can rise to the surface. It may take a minute or so. The strainer on top will catch any unwanted pieces. Notice how there's no fat in the spout. That's because the stopper traps air inside making it difficult for liquid especially fat to make its way up. Once all the fat has risen to the top. Simply remove the strainer and stopper and pour out the lean liquid leaving the fat inside the separator. A tapered lip on the spout minimizes drips and the high wall keeps liquid from spilling out over the top. See how the stock is separated from the fat. Use the separator to make a nice lean stock that's perfect for cooking or to make delicious healthier gravy to serve on top of roast. OXO's fat separators come in convenient two and four cup sizes with ounce and milliliter markings.",
