Start by giving it a good cleaning, including inside the lid, and remove any ashes from the bottom. You want good air circulation when you're cooking. And show your grates a little love too. I like to set a good fire in the grill. Cover the grates with foil and leave them covered for about fifteen minutes to let everything burn off. And because I like to start the season with a new brush, this is the perfect time to get rid of anything that's left. And since it would be a shame to ignore a clean hot grill, here's a simple appetizer. Toss defrosted store-bought meatballs in a little oil and place right on the hot grill. When they get good grill color, base them well with your favorite teriyaki sauce. Remove, add skewers, and top with chopped green onion and sesame seeds. Stay tuned for our grilling series. We've got lot's of food and tips coming up, see ya.",
