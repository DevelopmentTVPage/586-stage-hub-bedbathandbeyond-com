Also watch Tom blend President Barack Obama's golf club, Senator and Republican 2016 Presidential hopeful Ted Cruz's Canadian identity, and Speaker of the House John Boehner's suntan lotion (that he never uses). Why did we do this? Because pulverizing politics can be quite a rush! \n\nMany thanks to Bloomberg's \"With All Due Respect\" hosts Mark Halperin and John Heilemann and the folks at Bloomberg who are big \"Will it Blend\" fans! We love you guys!",
