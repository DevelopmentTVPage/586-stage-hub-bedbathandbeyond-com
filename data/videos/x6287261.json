    "transcripts": "When I was asked in my interview, I said look one of the things that I want to do is launch products. Well guess what you're going to be launching a ton of them. Honestly coming into this, I kind of expected to be more of just sort of float around where you needed but really the team gave me a lot of hands on projects I could own. So I was able to take on a lot of responsibility, really drives results in a very short period of time. When people talk about having real projects, this is a whole different scale. This isn't just an intern project this isn't what can we do to see if this person is going to be successful in his career. This is real things that are real employees would be doing we're going to give them to you and trust you that on day one you can do it. We're looking for interns who are very strategic in their thinking. Our goal is to bring in the best and brightest for a summer internship. There's a lot of excitement around the brand. It's really fast growing the interns will get an experience they probably wouldn't get anywhere else from responsibilities stand point. There are so many different things going on we expect them to make decisions they're empowered to make decisions. We give them a project that has direct and meaningful value and impact on the business. You're going to be working directly with senior leadership and working on the strategies that we're Implement. When I presented to these vice presidents, it wasn't with kid gloves. They ask real questions to be able to do that with leadership, the access is real access. It's an incredible collaborative place, you have a lot of access to senior management and an opportunity to really think through ideas and some great minds in the industry and people who are coming at problems with very different perspectives but a real appreciation of other people's perspectives and wanting to partner and ensure that we get to the best place for the company overall. The best parts of this company are the people and I think you figure that out, you know very early on.  When you think about what we do we take a concept. We develop it into a product, we launched the product, we then track the performance of the product and in order to be successful at that you have to be able to really sort of work effectively and efficiently with one another. And there are very few CBG companies if any that are growing right at this rate. I just got to contribute a ton and you know leave, leave here with really tangible products and results. And it was really good to see not just the result but actually decisions made based on what I worked on. It's been fun to know that I can leave an impact on the organization having been here a short period of time. The company in the atmosphere is very energetic and passionate  which has been a lot of fun. I have a wonderful manager, a wonderful team and it really feels like I'm a part of this place.",
