    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Mark from Human Touch and this is the HT Reflex 4 foot and calf massager. This comes standard with the patented figurine eight technology that Human Touch is known for. Where most foot and calf massagers tend to clamp on the ankle, and pool and trap blood in the foot. This actually has a motion that goes around the calf, forcing blood back to the heart and improving circulation. You have extended height for maximum message coverage and you have a built in control panel with two automated programs. Also, you have an ergonomic adjustable tilt base, to provide the perfect angle for you foot and calf massager. And to help keep your foot and calf massage clean, you have removable easy sleeves that you can wash and clean, and then put back inside your foot and calf massager. And lastly, the HT Reflex 4 foot and calf massager has easy handles that you can pick up for portability to take your foot and calf massager to any room in the house. ",
