Start on the front of your cheekbones and work your bronzer back with your brush towards your hairline. This will create the illusion of more lifted and rounded cheekbone. For step 2 to balance out the look, you're going to apply bronzer to your temples and hairline. And lastly to finish up your contour, you're going to work your bronzer along your jawline and you're ready for any occasion.",
