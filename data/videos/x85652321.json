    "description": "Accelerate a wine\u2019s aeration process with the Vinturi Red Wine aerator. The award-winning Red Wine aerator from Vinturi opens and develops red wines in the time it takes to pour a glass - no more waiting as with traditional decanters. The acrylic tower holds the Vinturi Red Wine Aerator at the ideal height for pouring into the glass. Using the red wine aerator with tower creates a dramatic presentation when pouring, and allows for one-hand operation. A must have for entertaining, the Vinturi Red Wine Aerator is perfect for quickly aerating an entire bottle of wine, or one glass at a time.",
