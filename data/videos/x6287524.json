    "transcripts": "The mineral oatmeal duvet and bedding collection by Kenneth Cole reaction home was designed exclusively for Bed Bath and Beyond. The first layer of the bed begins with the ivory sheets set featuring eyelash trim at the hem of the sheet and the pillow sham adding a relaxed comfortable feel. The euro shams add an ideal backdrop to the bed. They are 100 percent cotton in an all over knit pattern. Layering coverlet is also 100 percent cotton in a soft textured matte less say with a cotton Jersey reverse. The mineral oatmeal duvet and pillow shams are a linen cotton blend that has been stone washed to create a comfortable soft texture. The coordinating pillow shams are finished with the same cozy texture. The resulting bed is easy and relaxed, the decorative pillows accenting this bed suite are a square chunky sweater knit pillow in ivory, an oblong text below, and a rectangular 100 percent cotton pillow with textured fabric with raw edges in oatmeal. The pillows add the key fashion elements to complete this bed look. The mineral oatmeal duvet and bedding collection is part of the Kenneth Cole reaction home collection. It is available exclusively online and at select Bed Bath and Beyond stores.",
