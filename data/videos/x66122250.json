To prevent Braava jet\u2122 from going into other rooms, an invisible barrier can be created with Virtual Wall\u00ae Mode so that the robot will avoid cleaning part of a room or a different floor type. You can also use Virtual Wall Mode to divide a larger room into smaller areas to help Braava jet clean more efficiently.",

    "transcripts": "You can easily create an invisible boundary with the virtual wall mode to keep your Braava jet robot in rooms without a room, such as kitchens and entry ways. To use this virtual wall mode, make sure the robot is turned off. When placing the robot on the floor, the invisible barrier will be created in line with the back of the robot. Once the robot is in place, press and hold the clean button until two blue lines appear on the top of the robot. This means the virtual wall has been activated. Now just press clean to start the job. As the robot cleans your floor, it will not clean beyond the invisible line just created. Virtual wall mode turns off automatically when the job is done. To manually clear the virtual wall mode and turn the robot off, press and hold the clean button until all indicators turn off.",
