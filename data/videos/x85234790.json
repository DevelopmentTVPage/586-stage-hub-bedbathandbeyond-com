Use the pass through window to play a game of restaurant encouraging social and sharing skills with friends. Sizzle up some snacks on the stove top and watch as it magically comes to life with simmering some tasty treats. Every great chef knows salt is the spice of life. Pint sized chefs can season their creations with the pretend salt and pepper shakers. After a long day of mixing up meals, mini chefs can improve their fine motor skills by hanging the utensils and cups on the storage hooks. There's even additional storage for plates and pots in the fridge and oven below. Made in the USA with some imported parts, this kitchen is perfect for playing pretend with friends. The best chef's kitchen by Step2. ",
