    "transcripts": "Hi. I'm Francoise from OXO. And I'm here to introduce our Mini Measuring Beakers. This handy set of beakers is perfect for measuring and pouring small amounts of liquid ingredients like food coloring, extracts, and lemon juice. Flat, nonslip bottoms allow the beakers to stand on their own, making it easy to set out ingredients before you start cooking or baking. The smallest size measures amounts as precise as one quarter teaspoon or one milliliter. The largest size measures amounts up to two ounces or 60 milliliters. The opening is large enough to collect fresh lemon juice. Each beaker has a funnel-shaped top and spout for easy filling and pouring. The Mini Measuring Beakers are BPA-free and top-rack dishwasher safe. They nest for compact storage and easy access in your gadget drawer.",
