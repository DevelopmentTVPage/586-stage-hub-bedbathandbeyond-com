    "transcripts": "Hi this is Felicia from Hoover. We've heard a lot of questions about the difference between the classic Floor Mate and the new Floor Mate Deluxe. I'm happy to walk you through it. The first thing you'll notice is the tanks look. The Floor Mate Deluxe tanks load on the side instead of the front and they hold about 50 percent more liquid. So that means less refilling when you're cleaning, and you'll be able to pick the right brushes for the right tasks with the Floor Mate Deluxe. It comes with both a wood floor and a tile and Grout brush. The Floor Mate Deluxe also has a clean boost feature that allows you to put down more cleaning solution to tackle those really tough spots. Oh and you won't believe how much lighter it is. The new one weighs just 13.8 pounds compared to 16 pounds on the classic Floor Mate. There are a few trade offs the Floor Mate Deluxe doesn't have the vacuum feature and the cord is a little shorter. 20 feet versus 27 feet on the classic floor meet. The nozzle's a tad smaller on the deluxe as well, but it does let you get into tighter places like the bathroom if you have questions let us know. We're always here to help.",
