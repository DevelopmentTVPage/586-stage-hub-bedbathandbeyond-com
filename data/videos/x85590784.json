    "transcripts": "I'm cooking Herby Barbecue Chicken today with char grilled peppers and lemon mayonnaise now if that sounds a bit complicated at the beach its not. I got most of it prepared at home so it's really quick and simple. These are boneless chicken thighs that I marinated at home I put them into a food bag with some olive oil, some lemon juice, some garlic, some herbs and a little bit of seasoning and the bag makes it really easy to squish it all around so that the marinade goes right into the chicken i'm cooking them on a medium heat turning them every few minutes so they cook all the way through and don't burn on the outside. The beauty of these little gas grills is that you can control the temperature on either side so this side is really hot ready for my Romano peppers they're gonna cook alongside the chicken until they're beautiful and char grilled all over. the chickens gonna take about 15 or 20 minutes to cook depending on the thickness of the fillets by closing the lid you're gonna create a more even heat like an oven so they'll cook all the way through really evenly. Once that's all cooked I'm going to move it all over to one side to keep warm and I'm going to toast some lovely rolls to serve it in. at home I've mixed some mayonnaise with some lemon zest, chives, salt, and pepper. All I'm gonna do is pile a bit of a chicken on their, top it with a red pepper and a nice amount of mayonnaise and there you are within 25 minutes we've got herby barbecue chicken, char grilled peppers and lemon mayonnaise, delicious.",
