    "transcripts": "Before using, always make sure to thoroughly sweep or vacuum your floors. Also, make sure that your pad is clean. You can wash the pads with a mild detergent in your washing machine but don't use fabric softener or bleach. If there is an odd looking substance on the pad, the streaking is likely being caused by dirt or residual cleaning products. If you have used floor polishers or wax space cleaners on your floors, steam products may decrease the glossiness. Refer to the wax or polish manufacturer for removal. If you don't wax or polish your floors, check the floor care instructions from your foreign manufacturer. ",
