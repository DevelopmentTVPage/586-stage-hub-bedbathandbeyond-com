    "transcripts": "Living with a room mate can be fantastic or a challenge. Here are some things. Before school starts, meet with your room mate online or on the phone and talk logistics. There might be things you can share. Find out what your school allows or doesn't by using Bed Bath's college information sheet. \n\nFor example what if you can bring your rug to warm up your common space while the other is responsible for the curtains. Another point-- personal style. If you're into sleek and modern and you're room mate is about pink and girly you'll have to compromise. With shared things like lighting try to find something naturally agreeably or just keep your style to your side of the room. \n\nAre you a morning person or a night owl? your room mate may be the opposite. Curtains, headphones, and earplugs all help but there will be time when you just want to be left alone.Talk it through with your room mate on how you want to manage meet time. Maybe your someone who likes your things just so. Will it bother you if she sits on your bed or browses your computer? \n\nLet your room mate know what's cool and what isn't from the start. Food it's one of the most common room mate fights. Don't dig into her precious junk food stash if she is not okay with sharing no matter how hungry you are. Then there is how to define clean. you might think no visible dirt or smell is enough while your room mate might be more of a clean freak. \n\nAnd last but certainly not least a good dry erase board has saved more than one room mate relationship. Communicating well is the key and it keeps little issues form becoming big ones. These tips for living with a room mate are brought to you by Bed Bath and Beyond.
