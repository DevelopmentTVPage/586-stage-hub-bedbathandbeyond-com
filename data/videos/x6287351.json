    "transcripts": "Dirt happens every day, vacuuming once a week is OK, but doing it more often is better. With so much to do it's hard to keep up. It needs to get done but no one said you have to do it. The standard setting vacuum cleaner robot just got better. Introducing the I robot Roomba 800 series with the aero force performance cleaning system. With 800 series we developed a highly efficient cleaning system that will revolutionize robotic vacuuming, from the airflow accelerator to the high efficiency vacuum. Everything about aero force was designed to multiply and maximize clean performance in fact the Roomba 800 series has a five times more powerful vacuum that removes up to 50 percent more dirt, debris, hair, and harmful allergens than previous Roomba models. The keys to this new cleaning system are to tangle free debris extractors these extractors break down and lift dirt, debris, dust, and hair off of every floor surface. And just as important these extractors virtually eliminate the hassle of hair clogs and jams delivering on our promise of less work for you. Great for homes with pets or allergy suffers. Roomba traps fine dust particles drawing them into a sealed Hepa filter bin and out of the air that you breathe. Roomba is all about making vacuuming and maintaining clean floors easy so you'll do it more often. Like all Roomba models just press clean and the robot gets on with the hard work. You can also schedule Roomba to clean when it's convenient for you. When it's done cleaning Roomba returns to its home base to dock and recharge. With I-adapt responsive navigation technology our advanced system of software and sensors Roomba finds its way around effortlessly, avoiding obstacles, vacuuming under around furniture, covering the entire floor multiple times. And focusing extra clean energy where it's needed most. Using persistent past and dirt detect technologies. It will also clean long wall edges, avoiding stairs, obstacles, loose wires, and it won't damage your furniture. All of this technology is backed into a groundbreaking robot. It's extremely simple to use and now you can get beautifully vacuumed floors every day. The easy way.",
