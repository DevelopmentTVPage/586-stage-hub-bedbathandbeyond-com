    "transcripts": "Living away from home is an exciting time. But you're probably going to find that your dorm room can use a few comforts of home. Start with a mattress protector. It will shield your mattress from all sorts of gross stuff like dust, dust bites, and allergens. For extra comfort and softness top you mattress with a foam top or fiber bed. Get cuddly with the down comforter inside a duvet cover, and a fleece throw. Don't forget a squishy new pillow. Leave the old one at home for when you visit. \n\nAdd extra sitting with some bean bags and a folding chair. A backrest turns your bed into a lounge chair. Opt out of the small hard wooden chair that they give you and get yourself a padded desk chair. Bring some photos of your high school friends and family to stick on your desk or hang on the wall. \n\nAvoid overhead florescence. Start with a floor lamp and a desk lamp so you have ambient lighting for the room and task lighting for your work space. Add a series boost of comfort and style with a rug under your feet and pass the cold industrial carpeting. Having a fan to move the air around and cool you off when it's hot is a huge comfort booster. brew up a cup of Joe and share pods with your new friends and you might just want your old teddy bear to get you through those tough moments at your new school. College is a great opportunity to be on your own but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the comforts of home.",
