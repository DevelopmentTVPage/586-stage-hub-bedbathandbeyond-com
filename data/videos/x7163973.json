    "transcripts": "I'm gonna show you some trade secrets on how to fillet a salmon. First thing we're gonna do is cut off the head. Pull up the gill and cut straight down. So what we do when we cut off the head is we expose the back bone. The back bone is the gate way to cutting a good fillet. Take your sharp knife and follow that back bone right down. Keeping the knife right next to the backbone. That's going to prevent you from wasting meat. You can hear the knife go across the backbone. Perfect. Okay next thing we want to do is  cut off the collar. That's going to help us fillet the belly bones out. I'm going to fillet the belly bones but you don't need to worry about taking out the belly bones because they come out when you cook it. If you do want to cut off the belly bones. The trade secret is keeping your knife tip up a little bit. That pulls the belly bones out. Next I'm going to cut off the fins and the trade secret is using the tip of the knife. You have better control of the knife when you're doing cuts like this. Now we're just going to move on to making the fillet look pretty. Final product, a beautiful king salmon fillet from Alaska.",
