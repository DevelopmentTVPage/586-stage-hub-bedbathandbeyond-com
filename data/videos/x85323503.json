    "description": "The Ventura Seat is a portable recreational recliner with armrests and adjustable backpack straps you can take just about anywhere. It comes in four colors: Red, Lime, Blue and Black. Armrests mean comfort for some of us and the Ventura Seat won't disappoint. In addition, it's filled with high-density PU foam which provides the firmness you need to prevent aches in your back and bottom. If you prefer a wider seat over armrests, you can invert the armrests to increase the width of the seat to 20 inches. Six backrest positions offer a range of comfort possibilities, and adjustable backpack straps accommodate people of all heights. The Ventura Seat is great for the beach, pool, picnics, spectator sports or for dorm living and video gaming.",
