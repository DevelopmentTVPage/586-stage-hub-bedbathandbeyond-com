    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHi, I'm Marc Fosh and today we're going ot make some boulangere potatoes with the Braun multi quick 5. So the first thing we need to do is slice the potatoes. So we just start to slice those very quickly. Okay with the onions as well can be sliced. Add a little bit of garlic as well, we just slice that into the mixture and then we're ready to layer the potatoes. Okay so we're just going to  line the bottom of this dish with butter just to stop the potatoes from sticking and also glaze on the bottom. And then we're going to start to layer this mixture of potatoes, onion, and garlic in the dish. So we can basically just pour them straight into the dish and we just save a few potatoes to finish the last topping to make sure there's a nice layer of potatoes on the top and that they look nice and overlap. So the next thing we need to add is just some clear chicken stock over the top of those potatoes. Some fresh thyme sprinkled over ad we just finish we a few dots of butter. Gain, just to help glaze those while they're in the oven. Okay so we're going to pop those in the oven for about an hour at about 180 degrees and then we're going to turn the oven down just a little bit so at about 120 and finish them up so they glaze nice in the oven. Okay, here we have the finished boulangere potatoes  nicely glazed. And they're perfect to serve with roast lamb with steak or any kind of roast meats.",
