    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Mary Rogers with Cuisinart this is our new color selection for our power advantage five speed hand mixer. It's a really fun thing to have at home to make homemade cookies or brownies with your kids or you know for a bake sale. You can do everything from cakes to the great thing about it is that like I mentioned it has five speeds which work on the slide control. It also has an ejector button you just pull on it and the beaters come out and you'll notice too that the beaters are slightly different one has a collar and one doesn't. And that's how you make sure that you're getting them in the right way into the hand mixer so they lock in place has a really nice chrome band around the outside for really nice decoration and also has a swivel cord that turns from the right to the left. And that's really great because it keeps it out of your way when mixing so that you know you stay where you need to be. Anyway so what I'm going to do today is going to show you how to make a quick and easy batter so I'm just going to turn this on and just loosen the batter a little bit and then I'm going to add my liquid. And this hand mixer actually see how tough this batter is because I didn't add enough liquid yet. This cake batter. And there you have it I think it's done. Notice how the batter didn't get stuck inside the beaters because there's no center post and that really helps an air raiding your batter. So there you have it our new color collection for our power advantage five speed hand mixer.",
