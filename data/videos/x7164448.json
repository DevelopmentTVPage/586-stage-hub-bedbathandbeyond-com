    "transcripts": "Hi Chris, this is Felisha from Hoover. You should never see a loss of suction with this vacuum. Let's see if we can get it back up and running the way it should. Turn your vacuum on and check the full bag indicator. If it's red there could be a clog remove the hose from both ends like this. And run a broom handle through it. This should not get any debris trapped in there. Let's also check the two filters, those can hold onto pet odors. If their dusty or dirty tap them out. Then rinse them in the sink for about 2-3 minutes each with warm water. Leave them sit to dry for a full day before putting them back. That should get your section back to the way it was. Let us know if you need any more help. ",
