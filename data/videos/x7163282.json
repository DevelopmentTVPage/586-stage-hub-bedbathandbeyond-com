Use the Board's corner spout to neatly guide food from the Board directly into bowls, pots or pans without spilling onto stovetops or counters. A generous, flat cutting surface allows for efficient slicing and dicing, while the raised back and side walls keep food contained.  The lightweight Board and soft, tapered handles make lifting easy. The Board is made of durable, non-porous, odor-resistant polypropylene that resists deep scratches and won't dull sharp knives and non-slip edges keep the Board from slipping.  Dishwasher safe.",

    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Mac from OXO here to demonstrate our chop and pour cutting board It makes chopping and moving ingredients from the cutting board to bowls, pots, and pans simple and efficient. The surface is large enough for slicing with a full size knife. The front edge is fat so it won't interfere with cutting. In the back and sidewalls will keep food from falling off. A soft tapered grip makes it easy to lit and the back and side walls form a spout to help guide food off the board. And non slip feet keep the board in place on the counter top. When you're finished, the chop and pour cutting board is dishwasher safe for easy cleanup.",
