Combine sour cream with lime juice, hot sauce, and chopped cilantro. Stir well and set aside. Then add olive oil to peeled, deveined shrimp, and season with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and kosher salt. Mix to coat. Place the shrimp on a grill grate with corn tortillas over a medium hot grill. I like a grill grate because it helps tings form falling through. Yet still lets the flame through. And this one is non-stick, and in the grilling world that can be a big help. Cook until the shrimp are done. And the tortillas are just getting crispy. Then add some sour cream sauce to a tortilla, chipped red cabbage, the beautifully cooked shrimp, and finally a squeeze of fresh lime juice. I said better outside? I need to change that to way better outside.",
