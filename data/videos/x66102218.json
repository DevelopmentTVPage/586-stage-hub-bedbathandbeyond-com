IT can be used to clean both carpets and bare floors. The setting you choose for the carpet brushroll depends on the floor type that you're cleaning. For gentle cleaning on hard floors area rugs, slide the switch to the low setting. the brushroll will spin slowly. For deep cleaning on carpets, slide the switch to the high setting to remove embedded dirt. This setting is also great for surface litter pickup for carpets and area rugs.  A green light on the floor nozzle let's you know that the brushroll is spinning. If you're vacuuming on deep carpet and the light turns red, slide the thick carpet switch open  for easier maneuverability. You can even get underneath furniture by lowering the vacuum close to the ground. Turn the unit off, slide the button back to the off position. It's that easy!",
