    "transcripts": "This is the Breville Juice Fountain Plus and it's the perfect juicer for those just getting into the juicing lifestyle. It's easy to use; only to settings high and low. Use low to make the blade spin slower for juicing soft fruits and leafy greens. Use the high speed to cut through tougher foods like apples. This is the first juicer to hit the mark at a 3 inch feed tube so you can use whole fruits and vegetables even dense vegetables such as beats can go in which are packed with wonderful antioxidants. Really you can try whatever combinations you have in your fridge and after the fun element of experimentation, you get to know what you like. celeries, apples, carrots allcome well with beets but to give a little extra hit at some ginger but go easy on the ginger because it can overpower you. I tend to try fruit and veggie combinations. A handy trick is to line your pulp container with a produce plastic bag for an even easier cleanup. Breville juicers are easy to clean you don't need a tool to dismantle it. Simply transfer it to the sink give your parts a rinse and place in the top shelf of your dishwasher. There is an included cleaning brush I always use this to give my filter a little extra care right after juicing. The Juice Fountain Plus another great Innovation by Breville",
