Si I'm going to show you how to make an amazing fish stick taco in only five minutes. Just stick with me. Get it? Stick with me. The time consuming part of cooking fish sticks is first waiting for the oven to heat up and then waiting for them to back. We we avoid all that by microwaving the frozen fish sticks about 30 seconds or until soft. Then putting them into a hot pan along with a corn tortilla. While they heat combine sour cream with green salsa and then chop a little cabbage. By the way, cabbage is a \"Vegetable\". This is something your families will be very happy you're using. When the fish sticks and tortilla are both a little crispy, remove from the pan, put some of the sour cream on the tortilla, add the cabbage, the fish sticks, and a squeeze of lime. Okay  I know you think these might sound crazy - but if crazy tastes this good, I'll take it all the time.",
