One of the first things I look at is the firmness of the fish and this is a nice firm fish. Any fish that you buy whether it's trout, havoc, salmon, you look for a nice firm fish. Another thing I look at is the belly but make sure it's a nice clean belly with no browning. You're looking for bright colors on everything. If you forget everything I told you, you can always remember to smell the fish. It should smell like the ocean. I don't worry about the eyes they don't tell me anything because a lot of times the eyes can be damaged in some way but this is a beautiful King salmon. The fish men took care of it, the processors took care of the salmon, and now we're going to take care of this salmon",
