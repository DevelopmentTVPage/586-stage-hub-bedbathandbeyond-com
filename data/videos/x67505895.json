What I love about this new oven is that it comes with a good heavy roasting pan and I'm going to use the feature that is speed convection. Salmon cooks very quickly, you want to get lots of heat so that the texture on the outside is nice and crisp and the inside is perfectly and delicately cooked. With speed convection, my two salmon fillets are perfectly cooked in just fifteen minutes. Salmon is beautifully pink, walnuts are nice and crispy, and that's ready to go to the dinner table.",
