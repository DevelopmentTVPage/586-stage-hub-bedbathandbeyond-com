Wine lovers know when wine is properly aerated it improves the aromatic layers resulting in a better bouquet, enhance flavors and a smoother finish with every glass. Vinturis unique aeration process will let you experience the full essence of everyone young or old. Instantly aerate your wine one class of time no more waiting for your wine to breathe or pour into a decanter. Open up your wine and experience greater depth and range of interesting flavors. The Vinturi aerator comes with the drip stand and filter that catches any sediment or court left in the bottle. The aerator is very useful whether you're pouring an entire bottle or if you are like me and you just want to enjoy glass at a time. Here's how it works, I'm going to hold the aerator above my glass making sure not to block any of the air tubes, after all the air when in contact with the wine allows it to air weight quickly, make sure the wine is at the halfway point the bowl to maintain pressure and to avoid leakage through the air holes. Now I'm going to pour the red wine, hear that that sound is unique to Vinturi aerators and you know your venture is working when you hear that sound. By the way this stand is really convenient if you're pouring multiple glasses. The Vinturi red wine aerator is an essential part of any home bar, I do before and after sampling with my Vinturi red wine aerator it makes a dramatic difference and improves the flavors of all wines instantly, enjoy.",
