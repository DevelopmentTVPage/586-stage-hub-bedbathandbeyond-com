    "transcripts": "I created a blog called The Sartorialist it was very simple is just kind of a goof in the beginning just wanted to go out and take pictures and share pictures on the internet people chat the street style before but I think I just had a little different take I was in the fashion business before and it just kind of took off. To me style is nonverbal communication that really tells you something about the person before you had a chance to meet them it's something very personal because everybody comes to the world with a different point of view with different life experiences it's one of those kind of ambiguous words it means something different to everybody and so I don't think there's any more one trend may be in the 40's, the 50s men had to kind of fit into this idea this is how a man look and now there's really not a map for that and I think guys really feel uncomfortable in exploring that in the way they dress and the way they groom, the thing I've realized as I've gotten older is that, to be elegant you don't have to be precious, you can still be Groomed, but have a little bit of a masculine edge to it and that's when I think I started wearing a little bit more stubble when you travel a lot I found the more simple the regime the easier it is and the better it is for me. I just use a lotion for my face, a Braun trimmer and that's about it. I love the fact that we're in a moment right now where guys are feeling comfortable to let their style out to express all the infinite variety of masculinity.",
