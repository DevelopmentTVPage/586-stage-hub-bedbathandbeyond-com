    "transcripts": "Today we're going to cook one of my favorite French classic dishes, which is a Blanquette de veau. It's basically a white veal stew. We're going to use the All-Clad tk Dutch oven which will act as our vessel to marinate our veal, cook our veal and also serve our veal. So in essence it's a one pot meal and I love these one pot meals. We'll begin by taking our vegetables, putting them in the Dutch oven, covering that with the white wine and I like to use a highly acidic white wine. We're going to bring that up to a simmer, we'll add our cube veal shoulder and let that marinate over night. We're going to follow that the next morning or the next day. We're going to start to simmer that slowly. While you're simmering that you'll see a lot of impurities starting to rise to the surface. We're going to be able to skin those off as much as you can. Once that's done we'll remove the vegetables and the veal or we turn the marinate back to the stove and reduce it. Once that's done we can add our rich chicken stock to it, we're going to thicken that little beurre mani\u00e9, beurre mani\u00e9 is a very simple combination of butter and flour. We'll add that to the stock, it'll help thicken it. And then we'll add our veal shoulder back to our liquid and begin simmering that. At this point we can add our cream, then we'll add our vegetables that we'll be serving with. We'll let that cook until the veal is really tender, succulent, at that time we can make our rice peel off which is the classic accompaniment for the Blanquette de veau. Once our rice peel off is cooked our veal should be done. We can take that beautiful All-Clad tk Dutch oven to the table and if we're lucky and feeling very luxurious we can shave some beautiful black winter truffles on top. ",
