We're going to use the three and a half inch pairing knife to make supremes with the lime. First thing I want to do is cut the bottom and the top off to make a stable cutting platform. Peel the fruit slicing down through the skin trying to leave as much fruit intact as possible. This is great. Having a very sharp thin bladed knife for this. So we have our clean fruit. Next thing we're going to do is cut between the membranes leaving, for lack of a better turn, the skeleton of the lime. So now we're going to use our four and a half inch paring knife to make wedges for with lemon for juicing. Turning the fruit on to its side and making a 45 degree angle, I'm taking the seeds out. You can take this further and make smaller garnishes for drinks for shrimp cocktails. Okay here we have our finished cuts. We have lime supremes great for garnishing salsas, lemon wedges great for juicing, and smaller wedges great for garnishing seafood and cocktails. ",
