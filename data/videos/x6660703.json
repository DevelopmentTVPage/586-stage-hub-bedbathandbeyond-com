    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Mary Rogers, and this is the Chef Classic stainless metallic-red cookware set. You'll notice it's a beautiful color. I love it because it has a nice shiny red finish on it, so it makes for a beautiful display in your kitchen while you're cooking. \n\nYou'll also notice that on the bottom, this part is the encapsulated part, which is stainless on the outside and the core on the inside is actually aluminum. And that's really great for heat distribution. The other thing is you'll notice the contour of this handle. It has a nice valley in here so it's a great place to hold your thumb, and it gives for a nice grip when you're moving your cookware from the stove to the counter top or even back into the sink for washing. \n\nThe great thing about this, too, is all the handles are riveted on-- you'll notice right here-- so they're really well secured. And the other thing is you'll notice the interior is a very high polished stainless. And that's great for classic cooking techniques such as making sauces or even pan frying. \n\nSo that's the skillet. You'll notice there's another large skillet, two saucepans, and here's your steamer insert-- this is a really great item-- comes with a lid that also fits the pot that it fits into. This is great, too, especially if you make things like rice and you also want to add some vegetables to it. You can actually steam the vegetables in the top while the rice is cooking in the bottom. \n\nThe other nice thing about it, too, is it works great for a strainer or even a colander. So if you have something that you need to get the water out of just put this in the sink, pour it through, and you can actually drain your food item. \n\nIt also comes with an eight quart stock pot, which is a nice generous size. This is great for doing things like sauces and chilies and even boiling whole ears of corn. You'll notice it has a tempered glass lid with a stainless handle. \n\nWhen you use the lids you can use them in the oven up to 350, and the cookware is oven safe up to 400 degrees. It's a beautiful collection of cookware. It has all the essentials that you need for getting started in the kitchen.",
