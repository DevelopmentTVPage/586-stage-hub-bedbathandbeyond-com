Honey-can-do vacuum packs are a great way to help you stay organized and add to your storage space. Pack bedding, clothing or any items you want to store and or protect items should be completely dry before packing. Vacuum pack should not be filled above the fill line, never pack items with extremely sharp edges or points as they may puncture the vacuum pack, seal the vacuum packed tightly by sliding the resealable zipper firmly like this. The closure system ensures an airtight seal for ultimate protection. Prepare the air valves by removing the valve cap and opening the valve by turning it counterclockwise one full rotation, if you unscrew the valve too far it could separate from the base if that should happen just screw it back on until snug and then open it one full rotation. Now vacuum the air out using your household vacuum cleaner hold hose tightly against the one way air valve turn your vacuum on and when all the air has been removed replace the cap and close the valve by turning it clockwise until it is firmly closed and your vacuum pack is ready for storage. To open and reuse gently unzip the bag and carefully remove your items never tear or puncture the bag and vacuum packs can be used again and again. At honey-can-do we don't believe you have to go broke to have a beautiful well-organized home and assembly should be easy to do.",
