    "transcripts": "Homemade peanut butter is amazing and simple. With the S-Blade in place, put two cups unsalted, shelled, and roasted peanuts in the bowl of a processor. And add salt and peanut oil. Process about a minute. Scrape down the sides with a spatula. Then continue until the peanut butter is smooth to your liking. Check and add oil to get it to your desired consistency or even honey to make it a bit sweeter. And why should you make it? Well, not only is it delicious and can be much cheaper than buying it, but once you have it, you can use it to make it crazy good peanut butter banana bread, a Thai pasta sauce, and even a grilled PB and J.",
