    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Mary Rogers director of marketing communications for Cuisinart. This is the Cuisinart convection toaster oven broiler. It's really nice inside, it's quite large it's 0.6 cubic feet. It holds a 12 inch pizza. It's 1500 watts of power. It can go all the way from a warm function up to broil. So if you want to keep something warm in case somebody gets home late from work you can keep it on warm. It works great. \n\nThe other thing is it has baking rack and also a roasting rack. It also has a slide out rack there. It also has a removable crumb tray it removes from the front that helps you keep your oven clean it also has a non-stick interior which you just wipe up. In case you gets any spatters and splatters you can also toast using this you can toast anything from bagels and bread to even English muffins. It has a 30 minute timer and also this controls your toasting function it depends on how dark you want it. So darker here and lighter here and then it automatically is shot off. It has warm, broil, bake, toast and convection on this knob and this is your temperature control. This will indicate that you're operating with this red light here. It's beautifully designed has a rolled handle for the door knob and you'll find it really great for using every day or in as an extra oven when you are entertaining at home.",
