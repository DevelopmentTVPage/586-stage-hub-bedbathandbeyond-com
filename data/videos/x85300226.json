    "transcripts": "Before you begin, you may wish to adjust the position of your cleaning pad or the height of your base board's molding or window frames. Slightly loosen the screw on the back of the cleaning head and move the pad up or down. Retighten the screw to lock the position. Warning: Do not unscrew the Baseboard Buddy cleaner all the way. For best results, make sure that the handle of the baseboard buddy cleaner is at a 45 degree angle. Then simply glide along the surface to clean. You can move the handle back and forth to go in any direction. Ensure that the cleaning head is adjusted to prevent the plastic frame from contacting walls or floors to prevent scratching. For normal dusting, use the baseboard buddy cleaner while dry. If baseboards are really dirty, you may spray the cleaning pad with your favorite all purpose cleaner, degreaser, or use soapy water. Wipe the cleaning pad with a rag occasionally to remove excess dirt. Remove and rinse the cleaning pad in water as needed.",
