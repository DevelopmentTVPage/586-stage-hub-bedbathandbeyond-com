You can make burgers, you can make meatballs, you can make fillers for pot stickers and salmon burgers, and there's endless possibilities which you could use with this grinder. They even used to put in tomatoes and making fresh salsa. Today we're going to do a smoked trees of sausage, it's delicious. Start with a little pork shoulder here and we're going to mix in some of our trees of seasoning. We have this on the fine grind, we'll use our plunger here to kind of help work the meat through. I'm going to take it and I'm going to put it in a sausage casing or make or smoke trees of sausage and stuff and this is what we come out with this lovely beautiful product here. The food grinder has a world of other possibilities too, its rotors slicer shredder makes quick work of shredding cheeses, and it can even turn apples into apple sauce in minutes.",
