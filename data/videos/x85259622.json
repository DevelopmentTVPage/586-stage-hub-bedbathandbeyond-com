    "transcripts": "Good Job! \n\nThis is a review for the Little Tikes Trampoline. It is amazing especially if you have a couple of kids that way they can be entertained and you don't feel guilty of having them watch dome TV there. They can do some exercise another way and it's great because it's hard for those single parents or even parents with multiple kids. you know, it's very challenging. This is our sun, he's our 2 year old and he is super super energetic. So it's important for us to keep him entertained. And instead of jumping on to couches, he's learning to jump on the trampoline so I say this is a five star product. It's well built, so it actually holds up very well to jump- excessive jumping. Watch, let go. You can see the way that it holds up to my son's movements here and he's bouncing. He weights about 35 pounds, 36? nah 35 pounds. And he's super active so it holds up very well. he sometimes even swings on the bar which I know but we don't allow him to do but you know how kids are. And let me ask him. Elija, do you like it? Do you like you trampoline?  Do you like it a lot? Is it fun? Look at me. Do you like it? is it fun?  \n\nYes\n\nAlright, that's the review there for the Little Tikes Trampoline. It's uh Merry Christmas!",
