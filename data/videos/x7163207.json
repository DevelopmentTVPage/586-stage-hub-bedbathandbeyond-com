    "transcripts": "Cutting boards are one of the workhorses of the kitchen.  Reached for daily and used for cutting, scraping, and transporting food. We set out to design boards that were easy to lift, resisted warping, and stood up to the test of time. The OXO collection of cutting boards features soft tapered handles that make lifting the board easy. You can simply slide your fingers underneath the sloped edges to pick up and move the board. The non-slip seat on the edges keep the board  from sleeping on the counter top or table. use both sides of the double sided board to prevent cross contamination of the durable non porous odor resistant polypropylene surfaces. The surfaces resist deep scratches and maintain knife sharpness while the juice grooves retain any liquids on the board. When you're done, the boards can go directly into the dishwasher. Here's a good tip, professional chefs will often wet a towel and place it underneath the cutting boards to stop them sliding on the counter top. Our nonslip feet, eliminate this step.",
