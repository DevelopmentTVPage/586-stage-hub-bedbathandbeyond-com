    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nThe Cuisinart Chef's Convection counter top oven has fifteen powerful functions including convection, speed convection, and dual cook. Now dual cook combines radiant heat from below which will work great with this pizza and the broiler each time to perfection so you get the results that you really want. I'm gonna prepare a vegetarian pizza and pull it together quickly, pop it in this oven, but I need to preheat ahead of time. I'll close and begin to set it. Look at this incredible finish. Beautifully crisp from the underside and the broiler finishes into perfection. That exact heat sensor makes certain that the temperature remains constant throughout the cooking time. how would you like to have that pizza at home.",
