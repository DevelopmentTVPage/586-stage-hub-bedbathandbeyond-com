    "transcripts": "Salt is easily one of the most important ingredients in cooking, but now with Himalayan salt block  it's not just for cooking it's for cooking on. After heating slowly on the oven or on the stove top, it's ready. You could do meats and fish, all types of seafood, vegetables, or even fruit, but of course you won't need salt just use any other seasoning. You never cooking fruits? well you should, but the block can also be chilled in the freezer and used for serving things like raw fish r cheeses and fruits. And the cool part is that they stay hot or cold for quite a while so you can bring them to the table and use them for cooking or serving. And of course they impart a slight salty flavor that makes everything better.",
