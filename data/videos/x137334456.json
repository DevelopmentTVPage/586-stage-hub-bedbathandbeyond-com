I feel like the nutribullet has really helped me my recovery with just really great wholesome foods I haven't used something so much like to its fullest potential like you know like you get clothing and you know you use it and you throw it away after a while you know but this is like it's a solid foundation like you like people use it all the time I don't know anybody who has their nutribullet and doesn't use it. All of my friends are really like either have gotten one or like super jealous so I think it's essential for not only just runners but almost any athlete.",
