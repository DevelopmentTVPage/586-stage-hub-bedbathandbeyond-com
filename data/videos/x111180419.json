    "transcripts": "iRobot\u00ae Roomba\u00ae 560 Vacuum Robot\r\n\r\nThis incredible robot cleans your floors so you don't have to, automatically adjusting to tackle both carpets and hard floors. The  iRobot Roomba 560 Vacuum Robotrobot intelligence efficiently cleans the whole floor, under and around furniture and along walls, while automatically sensing and avoiding stairs and other drop-offs. The anti-tangle system keeps the robot from getting stuck on cords, carpet fringe, or tassels. The two counter-rotating brushes in the vacuum reach deep into carpets to remove dirt, dust and pet hair. Dirtier areas are detected automatically and given heavier attention. The system cleans up to 3 rooms in a single cleaning cycle, and then automatically docks in the self-charging base! Two virtual wall \"Lighthouses\" direct the Roomba to fully clean one room before moving on to the next. The robot also has a scheduling feature, so it will automatically begin vacuuming any time of day or night, even if you're not home! One-year warranty. Model #560.\r\n\r\niRobot Roomba 560 Vacuum Robot\r\n\r\nIntroducing the iRobot Roomba 560 Vacuum Cleaning Robot.\r\n\r\nThe latest in a line of robots designed to help you maintain cleaner floors. Roomba cleans routinely so you don't have to.\r\n\r\nIn your busy home, floors get dirty everyday. Now with the push of a button iRobot Roomba helps you stay ahead of the mess by cleaning more frequently. \r\n\r\nRoomba's patented three-stage cleaning system features a powerful vacuum and two counter-rotating brushes. This revolutionary system reaches deep into your carpet to remove an amazing amount of dirt, dust and pet hair.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike an ordinary upright, Roomba cleans the whole floor, under and around furniture and other hard to reach areas. It even detects dirtier areas and spends more time cleaning those spots. \r\n\r\nIts spinning side brush and wall following technology let Roomba clean along wall edges and reach deep into corners. Roomba automatically adjusts its cleaning head to effectively clean both carpets and hard floors. \r\n\r\nRoomba senses and avoids stairs and won't get stuck on cords or carpet tassels so you can feel safe letting Roomba clean when you're not around. \r\n\r\nRoomba 560 features on-board scheduling so you can tell Roomba to vacuum when it's most convenient, whether you're at home or on the go.\r\n\r\nRoomba 560 also comes with two virtual wall light houses that keep Roomba cleaning one room, then guide it to the next so you can be sure that each room is fully clean. At the end of each cleaning cycle, or when its battery is running low, Roomba automatically returns to its home base to dock and recharge for the next cleaning. It will be ready to go the next time you tell it to vacuum.\r\n\r\nYour floors gets dirty everyday. Occasional cleanings with ordinary uprights don't keep up with the mess. Roomba cleans routinely so you don't have to.",
