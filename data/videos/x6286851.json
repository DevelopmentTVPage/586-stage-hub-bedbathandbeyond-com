    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Mary Rogers with Cuisinart. This is our new Cuisinart classic toaster oven broiler. It's a really generous size but it takes up a little just a little bit of space on your counter top. The exterior is a combination in the front of stainless and also the knobs have a soft grip material on it. You have a full function for toasting also called out bagel feature broiling and also a regular baking. When you open the door. Notice how the rack comes out automatically it assists you so that when you're putting things in there like when we're going to toast it helps you out so you can keep your hands free to do other things. So you'll notice we can fit four nice generous pieces of toast in there we close the lid and it also pushes the rack in for you so you don't have to do the other thing that it has is a removable crumb tray which we just pulled the bottom out here. Like so. And it's really important to keep your crumb tray clean so it's right in the front. Easy access so you have you're reminded to do it often. \n\n[BEEPING]\n\nThe other thing is that it has a baking in boiling rack which is removable and then the start button works when you're using your toasting features. But when you set the other functions it automatically starts for you it also has an auto off feature and the other thing that's really nice about it it's generous inside so you can put a whole chicken you can also put 11 inch pizza. It's 1,800 watt so you get really great, baking, broiling, and toasting functions out of this classic toaster oven broiler.",
