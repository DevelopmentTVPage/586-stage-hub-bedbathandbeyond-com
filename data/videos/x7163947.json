I like this cut of meat because it is very versatile. Lots of different cuts can be had out of this piece of meat. From rib steaks, to spare ribs, to boneless rib eye steaks or Spencer steaks. A moment ago we started with a bone in rib roast that we picked up at the market and this is what we ended up with. We ended up with spare ribs for the grill. Some nice rib steaks, some bonus rib eye steaks or some Spencer steaks. A double cut rib eye steak and a boneless rib roast or a Spencer roast.",
