    "description": "A delicious cup of coffee is art and science combined: the art of extracting rich flavors and aromas from coffee grounds, and the science of time and temperature colliding in just the right way, at just the right moment. The 12-Cup Brewing System heats water in the removable kettle up to the optimal temperature to help your favorite roast reach its full potential, and precisely maintains the temperature throughout the entire brewing process. Water is measured by an integrated scale and pumped to the brew basket in perfectly timed cycles, starting with a short cycle that allows coffee to bloom for full flavor extraction. The intelligent microprocessor monitors time, temperature and volume from start to finish, ensuring the precision of hand-crafted coffee with the ease of ordering at your favorite local coffee shop. You choose the number of cups and we\u2019ll do the rest, providing a pot of perfection every time.",

    "transcripts": "Great coffee is not a hassle. Great coffee is totally accessible. And really, all you need is great equipment, a little bit of know how, and beans that you really enjoy. If you have all that, you can any day anytime have delicious coffee at home. Even when you have great coffee beans. To make great coffee, you need to have the right equipment. When you're using a home coffee brewer, you're putting the coffee maker in charge of a lot of work. Heating the water to the right temperature, distributing the water across the coffee bed, and controlling the overall brew time. Coffee maker's ability to do those things have a direct relation to the quality of the coffee that comes out. And when a coffee maker can do all those things well, it will brew exceptional quality. \n\nThe OXO on 12 cup brewing system is actually one of the few home coffee makers that's certified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America as meeting its strict standards of quality and it's the only 12 cup system to do so. It's not only a coffee maker, but it's also a hot water kettle with variable temperature control. And both of those functions, the coffee maker and the hot water kettle, can be sued either separately or at the same time. All of this is controllable though an incredible streamlined backlit LED interface where you can control how much coffee you'd like to brew and how much hot water you would like leftover. \n\nThe importance of water temperature cannot be overstated. If the water is not hot enough, the coffee flavor is going to suffer. Now here though, the coffee is being brewed with water at around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, which is ideal fro coffee brewing. A scale in the base registers the volume of water and depending upon the size of the brew, a microprocessor adjusts the overall brew time and water delivery accordingly. Programming in a longer initial bloom followed by shorter pulses. When brewing coffee, once the water gets up to temperature, a pump brings it from the base of the kettle up through the handle and across the rainmaker shower head. \n\nThe basket is designed to maximize extraction of the larger brew sizes and takes flat bottom basket style filters. Another great feature is that if you remove the carafe before the brew cycle finishes, all is not lost. Instead, you have up to 60 seconds with which you put the carafe back starting up the brew cycle. The vacuum insulated, double walled, stainless steel carafe, as well as the brew through and pour through lid means that the coffee stays hot longer keeping it fresh. Inside the carafe, a mixing tube prevents stratification during the brew keeping the coffee a more consistent concentration throughout.\n\nWhen the brew cycle finishes, a freshness timer counts up so you know exactly how long it's been since the brew ended. I'd recommend drinking the coffee within an hour. There's also a programmable wake up timer so the machine will brew coffee or heat up water at whatever time you like. The removable hot water kettle is made up of thermal shock resistant bpa- free borrow silicate glass. And a really convenient thing for tea brewers out there is that you can adjust the temperature from 174 to boiling. So you can have water that's for black tea and water that's perfect for green tea. The OXO on 12 cup brewing system is an exceptional coffee maker.",
