In this video he explains why few things have the ability to create as much mess as waffle batter, because you can't control where the batter goes. Heston takes us through the Breville Smart Waffle, which has a moat that not only catches the overflow but cooks it, at the same time making clean up faster and simpler than ever before.",

    "transcripts": "one of my favorite family food treats is the Belgian waffle. The indentations increase the crispiness of the surface area and at the same time can trap any tasty morsels that are added on top, but of all the things I've cindered up in the kitchen a few things that have the ability to create as much mess as waffle batter. The reason for this is that the fluid batter used to make pancakes and waffles actually doubles in size as it cooks this expansion process is critical to the end result as it trapped gases inside the waffle structure to make it light and fluffy on the inside just like a sponge sponge trapped in a crispy toasted exterior. I'm just mixing together some milk with some baking powder these are two core ingredients in batter. Now pop this balloon on the over the jar you can see this balloon starts to expand and what's happening is a chemical reaction happening here in which immediately creates gas expanding so quickly it starts to fill this balloon and once the gas bubbles are created through this reaction the batter come into contact with heat they expand making the batter much much bigger. What's unique about waffle makers vs say making pancakes or cr\u00eapes is that they trap the batter pressing on them from above and below and mostly enclosed chamber now when you try to trap something in an enclosed chamber this rapidly expanding is pretty hard to avoid some over flow no matter how careful you are measuring out your servings as you can see here this waffle batter has no place to go but outwards over the size of the Machine and eventually onto the bench the design team at breville also found this side effect of waffle making somewhat annoying so they delved into some medieval history into the uncovered a novel historic solution so just like a traditional English castle the Breville waffle makers have a moat the moat not only catches batter overflow to prevent it from dirtying the waffle maker and the bench it also cooks the excess batter at the same time making it faster and simpler to wipe off once you finish cooking. Of course there's more to delicious waffles then making them easier to clean so the heating elements in the Breville smart waffles have been designed using thermal imagery to make sure the waffles are evenly browned from corner to corner. Better still Breville's waffle IQ measures the temperature of the waffle plates and then based on your favorite browning setting and whether you're making Belgian, classic, chocolate, buttermilk, or even custom waffles it automatically calculates the required cooking time the moment you close the lid and of course if you decide you want you waffles that little bit crispier you can always give it a bit more. The Breville smart waffle delicious waffles every time without the mess.",
