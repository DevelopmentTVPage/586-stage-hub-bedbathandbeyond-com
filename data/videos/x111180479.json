    "transcripts": "Hello. Is there anything more important to our health than the air we breathe? Well, here's something that may shock you. The United States Government estimates that the air inside where we live and work may be as much as 50 times more polluted than the air outside. Every day we breathe dust, pet dander, smoke, viruses, and household cleaners into our lungs, causing us to suffer from allergies and chemical sensitivities and to relive the same colds and flu over and over.\r\n\r\nThe Winix PlasmaWave Air Cleaner can eliminate those pollutants and provide you with clean, healthy air. PlasmaWave is the most advanced home air cleaner on the market. It reduces or eliminates the broadest range of indoor pollution using a non-thermal plasma of highly reactive molecules to break down contaminants. It's the same advanced plasma technology that's recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as an effective means of cleaning up America's toxic waste sites.\r\n\r\nIn your own home, Winix PlasmaWave technology is an economical and practical means of reducing airborne pollutants, including viruses, bacteria, molds, and chemical vapors. Beyond that, this innovative Winix design combines PlasmaWave with several other effective air-cleaning technologies into one unit, including true HEPA filtration that captures 99.99 percent of all pollutants, as small as smoke particles, and activated carbon to absorb unpleasant odors.\r\n\r\nThe Winix PlasmaWave Air Cleaner comes complete with a remote control and uses smart sensors to detect problems in the air, then adjusts the fan speed accordingly. You simply set it and forget it. And most importantly, PlasmaWave technology doesn't produce dangerous levels of ozone like many air cleaners still on the market today.\r\n\r\nThe Winix PlasmaWave Air Cleaner. It's the cleanest air you can make yourself.",
