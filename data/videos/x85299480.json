    "transcripts": "Sharing your home with your pets means a lifetime of love and companionship along with occasional spots, stains, pet messes, and odors. Now you can remember the good times with furry friends and eliminate mess with the Bissell Deep Clean Premier Pet. This Deep Cleaning system offers superb mess pick-up using water, Bissell formula, and powerful suction for a home you and your pets will be proud of. First, the Deep Clean Premier Pet spreads a mixture of water and Bissell cleaning formula onto carpets and rugs to loosen embedded dirt and stains. Then, dual rotating power brushes with twelve rows  of cleaning bristles combined with heavy duty suction to lift away ground in dirt, stains, and odors. When deep cleaning large areas, the Deep clean Premier Pets full with surround suction helps surfaces dry fast. The result is carpets that look feel and smell much cleaner than those that are simply vacuumed. The Deep Clean Premier Pet has several special features that make it even more. The water tank is 25 percent larger, which means fewer trips to the sink and faster cleaning. And heatwave technology is built into the Deep Clean Premier to help maintain the temperature of the water and cleaning solution while you clean. It also includes a hand held deep reach pet tool that attaches to the machine to target and thoroughly remove embedded pet stains. \nFirst, rubber needles inject water and Bissell formula deep into your carpets to loosen stubborn stains. Then, powerful suction lifts the stain away leaving your carpets clean and fresh. You can also customize the way you clean by filling this machine with the Bissell formula that fits your unique cleaning needs and lifestyle. Choose formulas that remove pet stains and odors. Refresh with a light scent, remove household allergens, protect against future stains with scotch guard, and provide professional style cleaning results. When you're done cleaning, you can easily remove and empty the pet hair basket which prevents dirt and debris from moving into the dirty water tank. Then, empty and replace the water tank. The Biseell Deep Clean Premier Pet makes it easy to care for the home you share with your four legged friends. ",
