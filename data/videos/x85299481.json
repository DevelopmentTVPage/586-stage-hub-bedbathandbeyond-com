    "transcripts": "Bissell's Big Green Deep Cleaning machine is quick and easy to use. Start by vacuuming the entire area. Remove the dirty water tank from the top and lift the clean water tank from the base of the machine. Take the clean water tank to your sink. Now fill with hot tap water to the water line that's indicated on the tank. Add two capfuls of Bissell solution. You got plenty of solution choices to fit your cleaning needs. Next, replace the tanks making sure the dirty water tank is properly seated on top of the clean water tank and you're ready to clean. Start the machine and recline the handle, press the trigger and make one slow forward and backward pass over the area. Release the trigger and make one slow forward and backward pass over the same area to suction up additional dirty water from the carpet. Avoid over saturating the area. The flow indicator on the machine stops spinning to let you know when you need more water and solution. Empty the dirty water tank into the sink and refill the water tank with additional water and solution as necessary. When you are completely finished cleaning, make sure to empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks and return back on to the machine. Check the brush roll and the bottom of the machine for dirt and debris. Quick, easy, and you're done. Bissell's Big Green Cleaning Machine. ",
