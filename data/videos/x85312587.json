    "transcripts": "The Bissell SpotBot Pet. This revolutionary spot and stain cleaner is hands free and easy to use. No more manual chemicals needed. Just set the machine on the stain and enjoy the freedom to walk away while it does the work for you. Bisselle's new Deep Reach technology delivers solution further into the carpet where the deepest part of the stain resides. Cleaning solution is released into the carpet and then suctioned back up to remove those tough pet stains. It's totally automated. Computer controlled action does the work for you. And for added versatility. The SpotBot Pet offers two customized cleaning cycles. The surface stain cycle is used on fresh stains and the set in cycle is for older tougher stains. It even let's you know when the cleaning is complete. But its features don't stop there. Attach the stain brush to the hose and you'll be able to thoroughly clean hard to reach areas like stairs, upholstery, and even auto interiors. The spot bot pet is versatile and will go anywhere you need it to go. It's true hands free cleaning that takes the guess work out of spot cleaning. The SpotBot pet removes up to 99 percent of odor causing bacteria when used with Bissell 2X pet stain and odor compact formula. It also features MMicroban antimicrobial product protection which prevents the growth of odor causing bacteria, mold, and mildew. The new SpotBot pet from Bissell. Spot it, bough it, got it. True innovation by Bissell.",
