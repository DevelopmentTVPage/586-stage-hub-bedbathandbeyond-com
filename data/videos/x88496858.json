To begin remove product contents and group all like parts, connect for support bars to the center divider using hex screws, use the hex wrench to fasten screws tightly. Next the side supports notice the longer sides of the attached support bars are on the same side as the right support and that the right support has three bars and the left support has two bars, make sure that the groups face one another like this. Now attach the side supports using hex screws and the hex wrench. The file frame is next position the file frame on top between the side support like this, place shelf on the middle support bars making sure that the grooves fit into place. Turn the office card upside down and insert forecaster inserts into the bottom holes of the side supports, you can turn the cart over and use your body weight like this. To see the inserts until they are snug as a bug. Notice there are locking and non locking casters, choose a side and put the locking casters on the same side of the cart. push them in hard until they click into place. Now gather the drawers and attach the drawer pulls with screws like this to each drawer, insert yours into their appropriate slots place, the file divider bar on the top frame to allow for vertical and horizontal file placement and presto you have a place to organize all of that paperwork. Now you can pay those nasty bills with the money you saved assembling your file cart yourself. At honey-can-do we don't believe you have to go broke to have a beautiful well-organized home and assembly should be easy to do.",
