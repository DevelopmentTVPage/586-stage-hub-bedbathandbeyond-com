With so many added features and comforts, you'll never want to use a regular chair again. The ribbed padding in its polyester canvas seat and back rest make it extra comfortable as well as durable. The lightweight aluminum frame has a 350 pound weight capacity. the low sidebars prevent it from sinking into the sand. The fusion chair comes with a fold out table with expandable fabric shelves that store easily under the table when not in use and molded cup holder to avoid spills. The fully detachable insulated cooler bag has a 24 can capacity. Special pockets for cellphones or portable music devices as well as secure bungee cords for a towel or additional items. It also has an extra large pocket for magazines, newspapers or books. To top it all off, it has an adjustable shoulder strap so it could be used independent of the chair for ultimate and outdoor leisure. this ultra dynamic chair includes 2 sturdy fabric loops on the back to secure an umbrella or sports banner. All of this comes in a foldable design with comfortably padded backpack straps for easy and balanced transportation.
