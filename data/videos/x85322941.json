The board swings open to reveal four stainless steel cheese tools with rubber wood handles. The tools include a cheese cleaver, a cheese plane, a fork cheese knife, and a cheese spreading knife. The Circo has over 182 square inches of cutting surface and features a recessed moat on the board's edge to catch the cheese brine or juice from cut fruit. The Circo makes a thoughtful gift and great party centerpiece.",
