    "transcripts": "There are two things I really love, one is the rib eye, what we're going to do in this case we're going to do the eye of the rib from a beautiful piece of beef and we're going to pan roast it through. So it's going to be pan saute on top of the stove, and then we're going to finish it in the oven. When you start it on top of the stove we want to start it a very very high heat so we get that really, that really crusty seer that we want on one side, we'll turn it over we'll do the seer on the other side to get it crusty as well. We're going to turn down the heat somewhat to take out a little bit of the the the oil and then a good amount of butter. Perhaps a couple crushed garlic garlic cloves maybe a couple springs of ti and start to ros\u00e9 it or start to baste it. You want to make sure the temperature isn't super hot. You don't want, you don't want the butter to burn right? You want the better to stay brown and that's a beautiful flavor. And we'll do that for a few minutes as we're roasting, as we continue to pan roast the steak, and then we'll put it in a high oven to finish it off. Testing for doneness is something that is certainly very important in the restaurant what we do is we test it by feel and if you keep the palm of your hand relaxed very simple way to learn how the doneness of meats as relaxed you touch your thumb right here and you feel very soft or that would be representative of rare. If you close your fist halfway and touch to be a little firmer and that will be more medium. If you had a real tight fist that will be well done. That's one of the the easy ways to start to learn the degree of doneness of meat.",
