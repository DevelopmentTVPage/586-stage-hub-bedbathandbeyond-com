    "transcripts": "A shortcut in your car gets you where you're driving to faster. And a shortcut in your kitchen gets you what you're cooking faster. And I have five of those for you. Not driving shortcuts - cooking shortcuts. Here we go. Instead of peeling kiwi fruit to get to the inside, Use a spoon it's a lot easier. Do you have a thin sauce you'd like thicker? No worries, just mix a little cornstarch with water. and whisk it into your sauce - and voila - thicker. Don't bother peeling potatoes before you broil them - because the skins will just slide off once they're cooked. When a recipe calls for cooked chicken, you can of course buy the chicken, clean the chicken, cook it yourself with all the mess and the fuss. Or... just buy a deli roasted chicken - quick and simple. And finally, when you need some ginger, forget the scraping, slicing and chopping -  just let a microplane zester do the work. shortcuts, they're so great. And they're not cheating. Really - they're not cheating.",
