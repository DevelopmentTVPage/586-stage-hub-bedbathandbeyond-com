Cook one pound of ground pork in an oven proof pan until done. Add a diced green pepper, chili powder and minced garlic - cook a couple minuted longer. Then put in a jar of black bean salsa - stir well to combine, turn off heat and top with shredded cheddar cheese. Add a beaten egg, chili powder and milk to biscuit mix, stir well, pour over the pork and bake about 30 minutes or until golden brown and wonderful. And the best part? it costs like \"this\" much. You have to make this.",
