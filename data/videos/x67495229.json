    "transcripts": "Take your blending experience to the next level this year by adding the Cuisinart Hurricane pro blender to your counter top. This elite blender comes equipped with a commercial grade three point five peak horse power motor, the most powerful motor ever in Cuisinart blenders. Commercial grade power combined with one touch function make the Hurricane pro your simple solution fro creating creamy nut butters, crushing ice, and blending consistent smoothies. The ultra large 64 ounce BPA free Triton jar provides stability and comfort when blending large amounts of the toughest ingredients. Exclusive blend logic's operating technology and automatic load sensing capability means this smart blender knows when to adjust blending power for preset functions that never miss the mark. Use any of the default pre-programmed functions for crushing ice. Making smoothies, preparing hot soups or cleaning or use the memory function to adjust the pre programmed settings to your preference or recipes you make frequently. The variable speed control allows you to customize your blending speed from 3,000 to 25,000 RPMs and the turbo boost function takes the commercially designed six prong stainless steel blades to their maximum 30,000 RPMs to obliterate your toughest ingredients. Where other blenders are aided in their toughest assignments, the Cuisinart Hurricane Pro rips through seeds and nuts for tamper-less operation. The tight seal lid comes with a removable two ounce measuring cup and allows liquids to be added directly into the blender jar when in operation. The Hurricane Pro comes with a 10 year warranty and it's refined gun metal finish ensures this powerful blender impresses not only in operation but in style. Pulverizing power, ultra versatility, and consistent blending results are just a few of the reasons to treat your kitchen to an upgrade this year by adding the Cuisinart Hurricane Pro to your counter top.",
