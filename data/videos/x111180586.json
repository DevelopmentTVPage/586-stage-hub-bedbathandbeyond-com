    "transcripts": "What can you do in ten seconds? You can start chopping onions for an omelet, or you can chop onions with eggs, chop ham and peppers, even grate cheese, all at the same time for the fastest, easiest omelet ever.\r\n\r\nIn ten seconds, you can open a can of instant soup, or you can make homemade soup from scratch, ready to heat and serve.\r\n\r\nIn ten seconds, you can begin grating cheese for a snack, or you can grate cheese, shred chicken, chop onions and peppers to make a zesty filling that you can heat and serve for hot, delicious quesadillas the whole family will love.\r\n\r\nAll three ready to heat and serve all in ten seconds or less with the original Magic Bullet, the personal, versatile countertop magician that does any job in ten seconds or less.\r\n\r\nNow you can do small, everyday jobs like chopping garlic or onions without the sticky, smelly mess in just three seconds. Or grind whole coffee beans coarse or fine in just four seconds for fresh ground coffee every morning. Or even take that fresh-brewed coffee, add ice, milk, and chocolate syrup, and blend up a fancy frozen coffee drink in just seven seconds.\r\n\r\nThe Magic Bullet does any job in ten seconds or less, yet it takes up no more space on your counter than a coffee mug. And nothing could be easier. Just watch. Simply load your ingredients, like tomatoes, onions, garlic, and hot peppers, into the bullet cup. Twist on one of the specially designed bullet blades. Pop it onto the ingenious high-torque power base, then simply press, and in less than five seconds, you've got just the right amount of zesty salsa, garden fresh and ready to eat.\r\n\r\nThe large bullet cup is even more versatile. Just toss in fresh fruit, ice, a splash of juice, and the Magic Bullet becomes a personal smoothie machine, pulverizing the ice and giving you a delicious, nutritious smoothie in just eight seconds. Or add a scoop of protein powder for the most delicious meal replacement, fat-loss drink you've ever tasted.\r\n\r\nAnd because all the blades, bullet cups, and lids are dishwasher-safe, the Magic Bullet cleans up in less than ten seconds, too. You could spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on a counter full of kitchen appliances that still won't do everything the Magic Bullet can.",
