    "transcripts": "There is a bag check indicator on the topic the bag door, that will be green during normal operation and will turn red when the bag is full. Or if there is an obstruction in the novel, hose, tools, or bag opening that is blocking the airflow. To open the bag door push up on the One-Touch door release latch, and pull the handle forward. To discard the bag carry the bag door with the bag still attached to the trash. Push on the red lever and the clean drop bag release will drop the full bag into the trash without you having to touch it. Do not try to clean out a dirty bag and reuse it. Dirty bag should always be thrown away and replaced. To install a new bag hold the bag as shown here, and slide the cardboard sleeve into the bag holder until the bag is secure. With the bag tucked neatly inside the bag door set the bottom tabs into the slots, pivot the handle and lock into place. ",
