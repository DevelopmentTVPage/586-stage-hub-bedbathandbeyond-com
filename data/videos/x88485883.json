This year though we're trying a few things to make daily chores even more fun first step making a giant chore chart made with a chalkboard and chalk board pen nothing makes them feel prouder than putting a star on a chart so we made those big and shiny the great thing about using chalk board is it can be easily changed when the unexpected happens. With cold and flu season coming upon us I can add an extra disinfecting jobs to be proactive for instance when I notice edie has some sniffles her usual job of put the toys away gets shifted to me so I can quickly disinfect and get those germs away from her and the kids toys these common services can hold cold and flu germs for up to 48 hours and these wipes they kill ninety-nine point nine percent of them often household tasks need supervision so I try to work alongside them to give them a little direction and help avoid frustration. I can get behind any quality family time that's also productive time [Music]",
