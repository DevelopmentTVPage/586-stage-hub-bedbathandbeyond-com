As the first magnetic drive blender for home use, the torrent blender is one of a kind. From morning to night it can help you create a wide variety of recipes. In the morning start your day with a peaches and green smoothie. Just add one cup of ice, one cup of fresh spinach, peach slices, almond milk, and honey. The perfect combination to start the day. A few hours later create a healthy lunch using Poblano peppers, onion, celery, carrots, and garlic. Fresh and delicious, and when you begin thinking about an evening cocktail, combine cream of coconut, chocolate, almond extract, your favorite vodka, and fresh raspberries. Then let the torrent blender do the rest for the perfect dessert cocktail. The torrent blender was designed to work more so you can work less. Just like our iconic stand mixer we've combined high power, high style, and low effort to create a bold new blender. The torrent blender from Kitchen Aid, blend more, work less.",
