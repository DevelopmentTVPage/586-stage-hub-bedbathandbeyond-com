    "transcripts": "I'm making brunch on the barbecue today starting the these cheese scones you may call them scones either way they taste great and they're made from a really simple butter. I measured some self raising flour into a mixing bowl, added some butter and rub it in. I grated some strong cheddar and tip that in, along with some smoked paprika, a little oregano and some salt and pepper. I cracked a couple of eggs into a jug of milk whisk them together and once I'm ready to start cooking I poured the milk and eggs into the dry ingredients and stir them together. I'm kicking the scones in small batches on this platter here, you could also use a heavy-based frying pan as long as it doesn't have any plastic handle. So I start with just a little drizzle of oil and then the mix goes on in nice big dollop like this well spaced apart and they'll take a few minutes on each side to cook. Meanwhile I'm going to grill some large open Pat mushrooms, stalk side down directly on the bars of the barbecue. When they're cooked on that side I'm going to flip them over and then into the well in the middle I'm going to put some butter, some crushed garlic few time leaves and a grind of salt and pepper and that'll all melt beautifully into the mushrooms as they cook. Once the scones are all done I'm going to fry some eggs so a little bit more oil on my platter and just crack the eggs on and if you like you can grill some rashes of bacon directly on the grill bars next to the mushrooms. All I need to do to serve up is put a couple of scones on the plate, followed by one of my lovely garlic butter mushrooms, a fried egg and a few rashes bacon and that's it, brunch on the barbecue.
