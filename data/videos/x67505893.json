And what I love about this griddle is that it will channel the fat away from the food in these convenient little channels. Both plates are slightly slanted so that it will all run off and it runs off into a tray that is really easy to remove, dish washer safe, so it collects all the fat and keeps it away from the food. I got some butter right here for the griddle. A little bit of butter goes a long way with these perfect pancakes. And the thing that I like is that I can use the entire surface and get at least four at a time so I can  serve large groups of people or if I want, I can turn off just one side and make breakfast for two. Now that the bubbles have developed on top, these pancakes are perfect and ready to be turned. With my hotcakes off, now I can finish with some perfect over easy eggs. I can get up to six eggs on this griddle and look at this finish. I've got beautiful fresh berries, tiny little pad of butter, and maple syrup .",
