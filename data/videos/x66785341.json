    "transcripts": "This is The Ikon multi-speed Juice Fountain and it's one of the most versatile juicers on the market. The powerful motor can use even the hardest vegetables feeling An 8-ounce glass in just five seconds. That user has 5 speeds the low speeds are for softer fruits and leafy green vegetables while the high speeds are for juicing dense foods like carrots apples and beets. The 3 inch feed tube at the top is wide enough to feed an entire Apple. You don't have to peel or cut down the fruit to size. You're producing faster and easier. The juice goes directly into the jug while the seeds and  in waste go into the pump container. And the included spout lets you juice directly into your glass. You can even use pineapples with the rime on keeping all those vital nutrients which are right underneath the surface of the skin. And because various speeds gives you greater juice yields you end up with more juice in your glass and dryer pulp. But remember that they\u2019re many great Great uses for your pulp too. You can add vegetable pulp to baking dishes, lasagna, or to thicken sauces or give a little back to your garden by using it as a compost.

There is an included cleaning brush for your filter basket. I always use this to give it a little extra care right after juicing to get out any stains and sediments out of the Fine mesh filter The Ikon multi-speed Juice Fountain another great Innovation from Breville.",
