Its elegantly brushed stainless steel Cuisinart CleanWater Filtration Systembase is compact enough for any kitchen counter and perfect for any room in the house. Its advance water filtration system improves taste and cleanliness of water. Additional features include long-lasting filter, three temperature options (hot, cold and room temperture) and touchpad controls. The 2-gallon water dispenser means few fill-ups, too. Environmentally friendly. Includes two free filters - 6 months of usage. Limited 3-year warranty. Model # WCH-1500.\r\n\r\nHi, I\u0092m Mary Rogers, Director of Marketing Communications for Cuisinart.  This is the new Cuisinart CleanWater Filtration System.  This model is two gallons.  It\u0092s extremely easy and convenient to use.  \r\n\r\nAfter you prepare your filter and you fill your tank with water, set the filter timer, which will let you know when it\u0092s time it change your filter.  It\u0092s right in the top here.  You can actually get the filters online as a replacement filter as you use your water filtration system.\r\n\r\nThis machine works on what\u0092s called thermal electricity, so it doesn\u0092t have a compressor.  It\u0092s very quiet.  It also has little or no vibration.  \r\n\r\nIt has three great features.  It filters hot, cold, and room temperature water.  So you can get room temperature water for things like cooking.  And our machine is shaped curve in the front so you can fit a pot right under the spout.  \r\n\r\nThe other thing it\u0092s great for is making hot tea, hot chocolate.  You can have a glass of room temperature water, a glass of really cold water.  And like I said, it holds two gallons, so that\u0092s plenty of water for you and your family.  \r\n\r\nIt has a stainless steel finish.  The great thing about this unit is it has an energy saver feature so if you\u0092re not going to be using a lot of hot water, say, in the summer, you can turn it on, and the light will light up.  And what that will do is that will actually shut down the hot water system and the clean water filtration system so that if you are gonna be using a lot less hot water, you can conserve a lot more energy that way.\r\n\r\nIt\u0092s a great product.  It gives you filtered water for you and your family in a nice capacity, in a very small footprint, and you know what?  You\u0092ll never have to carry a bottled water home from the store again.",
