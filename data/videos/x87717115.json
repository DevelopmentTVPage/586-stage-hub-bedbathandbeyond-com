Let's start by taking things off the counter to give more room, the paper towels now live on the back of a lower cabinet door. And while we are down here lets install a narrow slide out organizer to keep everything together. Moving up to the drawers, Cheryl will use an expandable silverware tray, and keep her sharp knives together with an in drawer knife mat. Now shes on a role, and her cupboards will go a tear to turn table roll that will really maximize space. on the back of the door she puts a pantry organizer, making it easy to see and find anything she needs. A hanging rack keeps her pots and pans above and out of the way. Also giving her back valuable drawer space, and finally a rolling work station with an end grade cutting board gives Cheryl extra work space when she needs it and extra entertaining space when she deserves it, and looking at everything we've done I think we did a pretty good job, What do you think Cheryl?
