    "transcripts": "Summer entertainment is the best. It's casual, it's bare feet, ripped jeans, it's outside, and this table is a blank canvas waiting to be turned into a picture. Let me show you how. Let's start with place mats. I'm using a really hardy one that goes great with my table. And next up is napkins and a little fun color is always welcome. Then of course you have to have silver ware-- that's obvious. Then I'm adding my favorite Tervis tumblers as water glasses and because they are double walled, they won't leave a glass ring because they can't sweat. A shadow proof BPA wine glass always perfect for outside. Plates of course. And even outside, I'm still a fan of China. They just feel more substantial to me. \n\nOn to refreshments, start with a beautiful pitcher and you'll never be sorry when you have one that holds a lot, just trust me. And a really wonderful double walled beverage tub fro keeping a lot of things colder a lot longer. and of course you;ll need some food which is really my way of showing of some serving pieces. I love a long platter because they'll hold everything including this perfectly grilled steak. And this wonderful rectangular serving bowl hold a simple heirloom and tomato salad. It's perfect. And when you're all set, sit back and take it all in. And done right, you can certainly see that outside is the best side.",
