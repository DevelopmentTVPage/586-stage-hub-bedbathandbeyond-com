    "transcripts": "The Vulcan with trolley is a Picnic Time original design and the ultimate tailgating cooler and propane barbecue set on wheels. Don't be fooled by similar items on the market. Only Picnic Time's patented Vulcan with trolley features a large cooler that conveniently nests inside the compartment that houses the portable propane barbecue. The tore carries the barbecue in a full in a fully loaded cooler at the same time. This patented innovative design features a large insulated and fully removable water resistant cooler that holds up to 24 12 ounce cans. Unzip the cooler from the main tote to access the portable propane barbecue grill that's included. The cooler has two carry straps on either side and a mesh pocket on the interior lid that fits a large ice or gel pad. The Vulcan also features an adjustable shoulder strap with comfort pad, a reinforced waterproof base, and three large zippered exterior pockets to store personal effects and tailgating supplies. It has two drawer string pockets to hold propane tanks, padded carrying handles, and a stretch cargo cord on top of the tote to carry a blanket or towel. The tote includes a portable propane barbecue grill with lid, one black drawstring bag to hold the grill after use, a trolley with telescoping handle, and four inch wheels, a large spatula featuring a bottle opener, grill scraper, and serrated edge for cutting, a pair of tongs, and a barbecue fork. All three tools are stainless steel with aluminum handles. The trolley makes transportation a breeze and is 39 inches tall with a telescoping handle. It has a maximum load capacity of 77 pounds. Don't be caught without the Vulcan at you next tailgating party.",
