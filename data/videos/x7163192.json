    "transcripts": "Whether you're zesting citrus for a marinade or a lemon chiffon pie or cutting a lemon twsit fro your martini, a zester is an essential tool for every kitchen and bar. The OXO lemon zester is two tools in one. The sharp holes and the stainless steel head remove the zest from the pith of lemons and other citrus fruits easily and a channel knife in the back makes it easy to create beautiful garnishes. The soft bulb shaped handle nestles comfortably in your palm and is designed to prevent it from spinning in your hand even when your hands are wet or oily. The lemon zester can also be used on other citrus fruits such as oranges limes and grapefruit and is dishwasher safe fro easy clean up. Here's a good tip. When using the zester for cocktails, zest over the glass or cocktail shaker so that the oils from your lemon are able to infuse the cocktail during your preparation.",
