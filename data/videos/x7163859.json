    "transcripts": "Hi my name is Victor Martinez, and am a proud Char-Broil customer. And I'm his dad. I originally bought the Char-Broil grill for dad. I was really so amazed by the quality of the product and that wouldn't you know it 2 months later I ended up turning around and buying one myself. Because you got the infrared cooker, that limits the heat of the open flame from reaching the top it cooks and an immense amount of heat and due to that I got a steady cook all the way through my meat.My favorite feature of the Char-Broil grill is the versatility that you have from grilling the rib eyes, steaks, Boston Road, Sterling, Seafood, a whole turkey, vegetables. Not only does it make great food but it's also extremely efficient. My favorite thing about the grill, is how hot it gets and it sears my meat perfectly. Because it completely avoids the extreme flare-ups.I remember I burned my eyebrows once in awhile. Didn't you lose your hair? You know that was from something else. The price. The taste is just fabulous. This is our lives around this grill and being able to gather other family members and other friends it's really that's how we live. even the in-laws",
