Then add a little more chili sauce to some sour cream and shred some cabbage. We'll use this later. \n\nLightly oil chicken thighs, season with kosher salt and place on a hot grill. Once you've flipped the chicken, start basting with the sauce and add a little more until cooked through. \n\nJust as the chicken is finishing, add some corn tortillas to the grill to get a little crispy. Slice the chicken, spread some of the sour cream on a tortilla, add the cabbage, the chicken, and finally a little chopped cilantro. \n\nStart your season by grilling something different. You'll be so glad you did.",
