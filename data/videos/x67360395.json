First thing we're going to do using our Calphalon chef's knife, it's a very stout knife which is perfect for this job, is peel this thing. We're going to utilize a couple different cut here. First thing I want to do is cut this in half to have a nice flat surface so it's stable. We're gonna go back across it and make very thin cuts. we're gonna take some of this and cut it into a matchstick cut. This knife was designed to rock through edgy cut. Our last cut we're going to be large chunk dice or rough chop. So here we have our slices for gratin, match sticks for remoulade, and wedges or rough chop fro mache or raosting",
