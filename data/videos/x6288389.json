Attach the harness straps to the harness holders. Place your child in the seat ensuring their sitting upright and not slouching with their back up against the child seat back. Position the harness straps around your child. Then fasten the buckle. Check for proper harness tight and pull any excess slack up to your child's shoulder area before tightening. Pull the adjuster strap up and away from the child seat to tighten until an audible click is heard from the clip that is a feature. Check that the harness is snug around your child.
