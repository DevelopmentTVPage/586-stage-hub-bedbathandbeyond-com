    "transcripts": "Fresh watermelon is the perfect end to any family meal. But slicing and serving that watermelon can be a messy time consuming chore. You could pay twice the price to buy pre-sliced or you can get slice right. The new way to cut and serve with ease. Watch as slice right makes short work of even the largest watermelon. It quickly carves out pieces that are just right for a snack or a healthy desert. Then simply flip it up over and it makes removing those slices just as easy. Watch that again. You just slice, flip, and serve. \n\nPrefer smaller pieces? No problem. Use slice right  in two directions and you'll have perfectly cubed watermelon pieces. The ultimate healthy snack. Best of all, you won't have to worry about messy grime later because with slice right you leave the rind behind. And that means you can use the rind as a serving dish or get in more creative. Slice right works with all sizes and kinds of melon. Like Honeydew or even Cantaloupe too! \n\nThe secret is the unique cutting pin that gets down to the bottom of the watermelon and follows the contour of the rime for perfect slices every time. And it's not just for melons. Slice right even makes the perfect cake server because it always cuts evenly then flips over for fast and easy serving. No more slicing mistakes, no more serving disasters, and when you're done using slice right, it goes right into the dishwasher for easy clean up. So why should you struggle when slicing and serving and why pay twice the price",
