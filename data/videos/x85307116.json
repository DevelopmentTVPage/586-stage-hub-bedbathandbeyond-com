If there is an odd looking substance on the pad, the streaking is likely caused by dirt or residual cleaning products. If you have used floor polish or wax space cleaners on your floors, steam products may decrease the glossiness. Refer to the wax or polish manufacturer for removal. if you don't wax or polish your floors, check the floor care instructions from your flooring manufacturer.",
