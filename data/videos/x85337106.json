The answer is yes Mrs. Meyer's cleaned a household cleaners were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A Meyer and I'm a home maker and mother of nine. Years later one of her daughters had an idea it came to her as she walked down the cleaning isle eyeing all the products with their harsh stinky chemicals there's got to be a better way she thought. Right then and there she made a decision only cleaners that smell nice like my mom's garden but they will work like the absolute Dickens on daily dirt and grime no gloves or masks required and so she did she named her products after her very practical mom and the common-sense values she passed along to her kids and now everyone who uses them discovers that a clean home can smell as good as it feels.
