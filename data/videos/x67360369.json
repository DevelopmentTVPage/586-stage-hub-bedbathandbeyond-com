Any soft vegetable like this is a lot easier to use with more control, very sharp. Square it off. Now this is my favorite part. Just pop her right in there. Cut it the knife down like that. Nice and it holds all the seeds in. Now we got our halves. So let's go down with the pith. So ribs are okay but they get a little bitter. So let's get them off. That's what's great about a pairing knife, more control. Few things I like to do, take a lice down you get about four here. Come right across. Or if you want something for the dip or easy for vegetable batter or some where to the small dice. This one is great for sauces. Fit right on top of the chip. That's how I like to do my peppers",
