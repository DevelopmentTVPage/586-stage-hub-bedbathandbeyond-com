And then remove the latch connectors. Now place the seat forward facing in the vehicle. Ensure that the base of the child seat is flat and that no more than three inches of the base hangs over the edge of the vehicle seat.

Open the click tight by pressing the dimple on the click tight dial and rotating the dial clockwise until it releases and lift to open. Pull the lower connector strap toward the child's left side and extend the full length. Slide the lower connector strapped into the board facing belt slots.
