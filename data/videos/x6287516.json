    "transcripts": "Exclusively for Bed Bath and Beyond the Mason Duvet cover and bedding designed in the studios of Kenneth Cole was inspired by his collections. The first layer of the bed begins with a creme cotton sateen sheets featuring an embroidered Baroda stitch in warm gold tones at the hem of the sheet and the pillow sham. Adding a subtle dressmakers detail. The knife edge euro shams add an ideal backdrop to the bed. They're in tones of silver luster tinted 100 percent Linen. The crisp matte Geo-quilted layered coverlet provides a sharp contrast to the free form urban texture of the duvet cover pattern. The Mason duvet cover and matching pillow shams feature a subtle take on urban textures, concrete grays mixed with golden and oakers to form a pleasing abstract pattern punctuated by strategic hits of warm metallic luster. Both the duvet cover and pillow shams are framed by a tight welt around the edges. Further refining this modern master bedroom suite. The decorative pillows accenting this bed suite are an ombre  velvet pillow color changing from taupe to deep indigo's, a hand embroider and sequined elbow pillow and a long haired grey and camel faux fur square that adds a soft accent. The pillows add the key fashion elements to complete this bed look. The Mason duvet cover bedding ensemble is part of the Kenneth Cole reaction home collection. It is available exclusively online and at select Bed Bath and Beyond stores.",
