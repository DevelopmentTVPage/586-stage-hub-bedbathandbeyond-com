    "transcripts": "The juice fountain elite story is an interesting one. In the mid to late ninety's Breville revolutionized the juicing around the world with the wide feature juicer. Basically we increase the yield that you can get from fruit and vegetables by about 30 percent because of the speed that we were running the juicer at and our patented system of central loading down the access of the filibuster. And what we found was that a lot of the juice bars were ditching their $3,000 machines and buying $130 juicer because they were getting much more value for money out of the juice for the customer. We started actually getting feedback from commercial situations and putting our products, you know testing them that way. We could learn from the experience and the feedback from the juice bars and design a professional product that you could use in your home and all the juice bars use it as well. By looking at all of the components and redesigning the parts to increase the longevity. These things designed to juice very quickly and you know large, large feed tube to put all the apples in and large carrots and whatever you could push through it really, it'll do it nine ounce cup in five seconds. So you're pretty much as quickly as you can fit the fruit in it'll juice. It's very very strong motor running at about 30,000 RPM that's revolution per minute. The main juice collector is old fabricated out of stainless steel in fact it's been on the market for probably five years now and none of our competitors have ever attempted to copy the juice collector. It's it's pretty well hand crafted in stainless steel in two pieces and braced together and it's quite a quite a work of art in itself and now we're finding those juices popping up all over the place in just bars.",
