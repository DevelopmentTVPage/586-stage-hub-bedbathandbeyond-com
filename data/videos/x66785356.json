    "transcripts": "This is the Breville dual disc juice processor. It takes juicing to the next level. It comes with a pure a disc so you can enjoy 100% fruit smoothies that we call froggies. Freshly made juices taste better and are more nutritious and once you get into the routine of juicing it's hard to go back to bottled or canned varieties. Fruigees are a dairy free dmoothie but they have a creamy consistency. Because they're made from fruit, You don't need to pack in the extra calories and thickening agents like yogurt or honey. With the puree a disc in place, you can place berries mangoes or bananas. For harder veggies and fruits, switch out the puree disc with the juicing disc. 5 variable dials allow you to customize extraction depending on what you're juicing. For dense hard fruit and vegetables, it should be up on 5 which is it 13000 RPMs. And for leafy greens and soft fruits switch the dial back to 1. Juicing combinations are really only about preference. You can start with the recipes in the instruction manual and when you've got those mastered, get creative. The Dual disc juice processor another great Innovation by Breville.",
