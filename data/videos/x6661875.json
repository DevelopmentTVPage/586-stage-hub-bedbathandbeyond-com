Whether you make it or buy it, take a ball of pizza dough and stretch it out on a lightly oiled baking sheet. The oil helps it spread without tearing. \n\nPlace it oil side down on a medium hot grill and cook about five minutes. And however it lands on the grill is the way it is. 'cause you won't be able to move it until it cooks a bit. And if it's not perfect, just call it \"rustic.\" They'll think you're a pro. Once it gets good grill marks, lightly oil the top and flip over. \n\nAt this point, it's all you. Sometimes I'll just brush the top with garlic oil and add shredded cheese for a side of delicious and doughy cheesy bread. Or add herb cheese spread, pesto, and shredded Parmesan for a delightful change. \n\nGrilled pizza. It's so good it's almost silly.",
