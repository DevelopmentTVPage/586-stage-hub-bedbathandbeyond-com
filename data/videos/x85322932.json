This putting green shaped cutting board is a fun way to prepare and display appetizers and makes a great conversation piece for your next dinner party. The 19th hole features a recessed juice groove to catch juices from cut fruits, olives, or cheese brine. A removable flag secured by hidden magnets with the number 19 engraved on it might just make your best shot of the day. The 19th hole is a perfect serving, cutting, and cheese board and is ideal for relaxing after you played a full 18. It also makes an excellent gift for golf aficionados who love to entertain in style.",
