    "transcripts": "Dyson heaters are forced to heat the room evenly. When you come in from the cold you need to be warmed up quickly. So Dyson engineers set out to develop a technology that would not only heat the whole room but it would also heat you personally. The latest Dyson hot and cool fan heater introduces jet focus control using a remote you can choose between focus mode for long-range personal heating and the fuse mode for wide projection to heat the room quickly and evenly. This new technology was inspired by the aerodynamics of fighter jets. So here's how it works. In the main body an airlock has been installed and that controls the air flow between the two apertures. The air flows forced around the loop where it's heated by PTC ceramic plates. In focus mode all the air flow leaves the rear aperture where it's channeled into a long range jet of heat. In diffuse mode a jet of air is also released from the second aperture, and as the two jets of air meet in trainmen guides the airflow over a 45 degree projector creating a wide stream of powerful airflow. We've introduced this new technology whilst ensuring that AM09 is still fast to heat the room evenly. This is because our patented and multiplier technology powerfully projects heat across the room. We proved this using a room mixing test. So as you can see we precisely positioned the temperature probes around the room. Then we run the test and observe the results. So from the results you can see that AM09 has heated the whole room evenly. Whereas some other fan heaters kind of little or no heat protection, meaning there's uneven heat distribution across the room.",
