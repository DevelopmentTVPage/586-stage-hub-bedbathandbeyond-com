    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nCelery is such a versatile vegetable that I'm going to show you several ways how you can use it. I'm first gonna start by trimming the celery. The first cut I'm going to show for you is a simple crudite. Just cut this in half and then going the other direction, depending on how big you want your slices for dips you can go maybe one or two three cuts and then you have your beautiful cuts right there. The next slice that I'm going to show you is a bias cut and this is just basically just cutting the celery on an angle. This is gonna give you some really beautiful crunchy bits for stir fries. It also gives you a nice presentation. And the last cut that I am going to do is going to be a dice. So I'm going to start like I did with the crudite and I'm simply going to cut some thin slices here. After I made my slices, I'm going to go across on the other direction. This is gonna be really useful for something like a tuna salad or a chicken salad. And these are our three different celery cuts. We have a dice, a bias cut, and a crudite slice.",
