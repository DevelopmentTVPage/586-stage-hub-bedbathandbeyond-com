    "transcripts": "There are some handy accessories available for the Smart Oven. The bamboo cutting board, and Tray is this smart space saver. It's bamboo which is the ideal material for chopping board since it absorbs very little moisture and has natural antibacterial properties. Bamboo boards are also a lot harder than most chopping boards and less prone to markings  from your knife. You can also use it as a serving tray because it has recessed handles that make it easier to pick up and transfer directly onto the table. This replaces the need for a trip or heat mat which will protect the table service from heat damage. But the clever way to use it is to keep it directly on top of your Smart Oven. And that will save you countertop space. The mounted silicon allows for the top surface to remain cool so you can store many of your common kitchen items such as fruit bowl. a knife block or even a loaf of bread. And when it comes to Pizza here, this is the first convection oven to offer 813 inch pizza pan tray. And depending on your crisping preferences you can use the nonstick pizza crisper that will give you supreme golden brown results or you can use the pizza stone which you preheat in the oven at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. You can also use this in a traditional wall oven. The Smart Oven accessories, a few more great Innovations by Breville.",
