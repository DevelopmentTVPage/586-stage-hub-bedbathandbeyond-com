Premium pet hair power brush and 24\" crevice tool eliminate pet hair from stairs, upholstery, and tight spaces. At less than 15 pounds, the vacuum is a breeze to maneuver around toys and furniture. The Navigator power nozzle makes quick work of pet hair from carpets, and, at 12\" wide, fits into tight space for complete cleaning. Its powerful 2-motor system with brush roll shut off provides deep carpet and superior bare floor cleaning. A 30' power cord and 12' super-stretch hose makes cleaning multiple rooms and stairs even easier. With a bagless dustcup, lifetime filters, and lifetime belt there are no additional replacement costs. Includes 5-year manufacturer's warranty. Measures approximately 12\" L x 10\" W x 35 1\/2\" H. Model# NV22L.\r\n\r\nIntroducing the new Shark Navigator.  The first no-loss-of-suction vacuum at a price you can actually afford.\r\n\r\nWhy do vacuums lose suction power?  Because the moment you turn them on, fine dust and dirt begins to clog vacuum bags and bagless filters.  And the more they clog, the less suction power you have, and they never work the same again.\r\n\r\nBut Shark\u0092s advanced technology keeps dust and dirt away from the filter, so you never lose suction power or cleaning power.  With Shark, you get the next generation of no loss of suction technology.  Guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe Navigator is the next generation no loss of suction vacuum, so you can have superior, bare floor cleaning, and get powerful, deep carpet cleaning too.  It\u0092s perfect for above floor cleaning, and those places that are hard to reach.\r\n\r\nThe Turbo Power Brush removes pet hair like magic from upholstery.  And look how the Navigator is so agile and easy to maneuver.  And with its large capacity Dust Cup, you can clean your entire house with just one lightweight and compact vacuum.\r\n\r\nBecause the Navigator will never lose suction power, you\u0092ll never lose cleaning power.  And you saw it for yourself in a side by side comparison, the Shark Navigator took on the competition and blew it away with four times the suction power.  And when you\u0092re done cleaning, the dust cup empties with a push of the button.  It\u0092s that easy.\r\n\r\nYou\u0092ll get the Shark Navigator brush and crevice tool onboard attachments, an extra 24-inch crevice tool, the versatile Turbo Power brush, plus lifetime belt and filters, and a five year warrantee, it\u0092s like getting a complete cleaning system for your entire home.",
