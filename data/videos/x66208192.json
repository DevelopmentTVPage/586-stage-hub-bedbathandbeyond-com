But one of my favorite combinations is anything BBQ and baked beans. cook diced bacon in an oven proof pot until not quite crispy. Remove most of the grease and then add diced onion and diced green pepper. Let soften for about five minutes.\n\nAdd maple favored beans, chilli sauce, worcestershire,  yellow mustard, cumen, minced chipotle peppers, and Kosher salt. Then just stir well, cover, and bake in a 350 oven for about an hour. And then just lift the lid and rejoice. But if you felt like putting them with some ribs, a little chicken or even a bratwurst, well they'd be even better.",
