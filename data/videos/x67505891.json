You can see I've got the grill smoking hot and the green lights have come on telling me the sear function is ready to go. I'm gonna put a little bit of salt, I've got some flakes, sea salt, and we've got some fresh cracked black pepper. We've got this gorgeous prime rib bone in. This is the decadent, this is the big boy on the block, this is a gorgeous gorgeous piece of beef. Some fresh rosemary and I'm literally going straight on the grill with that. Rosemary is gonna go rosemary down it's gonna crisp up some of that. You hear that sear right away. And the great thing about the griddler deluxe is it allows me to make that adjustment so I want to press down on that steak but I don't want to put too much pressure and squeeze all the juices out of it. And to close that up you can see how the lid adjusts. Press that down and I'm gonna set it and I'm gonna leave it alone until I get really good grill marks. Before I reveal this steak, I want you to see how much oil has collected. Imagine this will not be in your food. Isn't that great? and the nice thing is this can go directly into the sink or pop it in the dishwasher for easy cleaning. Now look at this finish. That is the only kind of finish that you would expect out on the grill on a hot summer day, but the best part is, you brought grilling indoors. This is one of the smartest indoor cooking pieces of equipment I have ever used. And let's face it, when you get these kinds of results, why wouldn't you have one?",
