Food slides onto the rotisserie tools with ease. With the rotisserie fork, you can safely remove them. With simple one touch operation, I select rotisserie and start. The preset is for 450 degrees in one hour time the chicken will be perfectly done by then. The exact heat sensor maintains precise oven temperature giving you even cooking and perfect results.
