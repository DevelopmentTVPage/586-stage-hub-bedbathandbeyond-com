    "transcripts": "If the belt that drives the brush roll needs replaced use only genuine Hoover Belts with your vacuum. Here is the Hoover part number for the belt on this model. To replace the belt depress the suction only mode lever to ease installation. First turn the power off, unplug the power cord and turn the vacuum over with the bottom facing up. Rotate the upper red latch counterclockwise, a quarter turn, slide the lower red latch to the unlock position, and lift-off the bottom plate, remove the old belt, remove the brush roll and be sure that it turns easily. If it does not remove the hair and strings that have accumulated near the end caps, and check again. With the lettering on the outside of the belt, slide the new belt through the guide and over the motor shaft. Then over the space on the brush roll where there are no bristles. With the Belt in place pull and press the brush roll back down into the nozzle. Making sure that the brush roll end caps are in the correct position, and the belt rest on top of the shut off pulley. Turn the brush roll to assure it is turning easily and make sure the belt is centered. With the tabs inserted into the slots, rotate the plate back into position. Press down and lock both red latches. Be sure there is no gap between the nozzle guard and the base. ",
