    "transcripts": "There's a reason push around buggy has been one of the top selling step 2 toys since it was first introduced back in the year 2000. This quality riding toy is just as fun for kids as it is helpful for parents. We use our for walks at the neighborhood, at the park, at the zoo, it goes everywhere we go. Our toddler loves the bright pink and purple colors and fun decals. And I love how easy it is to push and steer with the easy grip handle. the storage base under the hood is perfect fro storing snacks, toys, and other essentials. As we ride along, the steering wheel and electronic horn sounds keep my little driver busy and the sea belt keeps her secured even on bumpy roads. And because it's made by Step2, it's durable and wipes clean easily. I know this ride one toy will carry us to many seasons of auto door adventures.",
