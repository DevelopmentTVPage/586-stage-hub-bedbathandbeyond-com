Very sharp, nice easy grip, and the most control. Top to bottom here. Quick little tip, there's typically two shells in each bulb. Just let the tip of the knife go right in there just like that. Now I made that incision, i'm just gonna find that peel. Look at that. Now let's go back to the chef's knife and do a little rocking motion. I'm just going to go right across. My fingers guide me the way. If you're a little scared just let it fall. What else can we do with it? I like to do a little broom walk. I'm just going to go right across. I''m just gonna go three incisions bottom to top. I'll hold the back, go right in. One, two, and three. We're gonna go right across, easy dice. Now keep the tip of the knife down and just chop right across. Alright we have a nice slice shallot, nice dice, and a whole peel Shallot ready to go",
