    "transcripts": "Hi I'm chef and enrique and I'm talking to you from South Florida. And I want to tell you about this beautiful grill that I have next to me. This is a Char-Broil tru-infrared. I've been working on the restaurant for more than 20 years and one of my favorite places to work in the line is the grill. We make so many different dishes and now I have the opportunity to make it at home. Like if I'm in the restaurant using the tru infrared. I want to show secrets and tips and how to make them.After I show you how the TRU infrared works I want to show you how to make a very simple dish we're going to cook filet mignon with vegetables. For that purpose, we\u2019re going to use red pepper, zucchini, yellow squash, salt and pepper, olive oil. What we're going to do is we have our grill here ready and I'm going to put some oil on this beef on the top. Then I'm just going to allow the beef to sear. Once we put the oil, we're going to add some salt on it . And both sides. we have already 600 Degrees and this side of the grill and we're going to use it true infrared you can control the temperature. So I'm going to leave my beef here for cooking. in a few minutes we're going to play some vegetables as well on the other side. We change the temperature here. And you're going to enjoy it's really simple. Place your zucchini. and this is already hot so so we're getting a great temperature. Let's put some of our red pepper place it right here next to your beef. and it's that simple. our beef is ready. Place it right here and voila very easy.",
