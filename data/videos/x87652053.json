    "transcripts": "We've got the bone a disposable dusting pad and these are actually good for hardwood floors, stone, tile and laminate floors. We use them all the time in all sorts of different ways. It is super important for me to get a product that's going to work good to get all the dog hair up so my newborn's not covered in hair all the time especially when he starts crawling. It gets really super duper fluffy so it catches a lot of the fur and the dust and you know all of the little kid debris. Fluff it before you attach it to the mob. Just has velcro on the bottom of the mop and it just velcros on to the desk pad. You go over your floor it attracts all of the dust and you can do a quick clean sweep every day. Every single morning I would go through and I would just dry i would just dust the floor and just kind of pick up all the dog hair and the dust and the dirt and whatever kid project was being done. I'm going to show you guys the dust mop before, look at all the dirt that this thing picked up off of my floors. I started dusting and I immediately started seeing my floors become cleaner. I all I have to do now as we picked it off and throw it away. This really makes it so simple you're getting the same good clean every single time.",
