    "transcripts": "Fitbit Alta HR has a built-in sensor that continuously tracks your heart rate to help you get more accurate calorie burn information all day and during workouts. Optimize your workout intensity, see your resting heart rate and get more insights about your sleep quality. To see your real time heart rate on Alta HR double tap your display if you've already picked a clock face with heart rate you'll see your current heart rate whenever you check the time if you don't use that clock face simply tap the display twice to see your current heart rate. During exercise Alta HR helps you gauge your workout intensity with three different heart rate zones. To know which zone you're in just look at the position of the heart icon if the heart is at the bottom you're in the fat burn zone, the middle heart means cardio and when the heart rises to the top you're in the peak zone once you see which zone urine you can decide whether to push yourself a little harder or pull back on your efforts. With heart rate on your wrist tracking your progress in your fitness journey just got that much simpler.",
