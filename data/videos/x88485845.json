To begin remove product contents and group all like parts you will need a Phillips head screwdriver for assembly of this product. Notice this unit is assembled using ingenious support clips which have ridges inside join together like this and have arrows on the outside pointing upward. When joined around a pole the ridges go into the grooves of the pole and the clips form a cone shape which support the corners of the shelves. Also notice this unit has locking and non locking casters. Begin with a lower pole which has a small threaded hole for a caster on one end and a larger threaded hole on the other and attach a support clip by joining it around the poles bottom groove like this now attach a caster by screwing it into the threaded hole on the bottom of the pole and tightening it with the wrench. Next screw a bushing into the top of the lower Pole then locate an upper Pole which has a large threaded opening on one end and a black cap on the other and join the upper and lower poles by screwing them together like this, assemble the remaining three poles using the same method. Now locate the bottom shelf and assembling the unit on its side thread the poles through each corner of the shelf like this making sure the locking casters go on the same side of the cart. Next place the unit upright and seek the shelf securely. Now attached four support clips at the height of your choosing for the lower basket and lower the basket into place seating it securely. Then attach the last four support clips to the very top of the upper poles lower the top shelf into place and seat it securely. Next attach the hanging bar by screwing hanging hooks onto the ends of the bar and hooking it into place like this and voila your laundry storage station is ready to help you sort and fold all of your clothes happy organizing. At honey-can-do we don't believe you have to go broke to have a beautiful well-organized home and assembly should be easy to do.",
