So we're going to use the kneading hook for the multi-quick five. So in goes the flour, butter, and then just a tiny bit of salt there. So we need to bring this together so it resembles sort of fine bread crumbs. Okay so once we got those fine bread crumbs, add some sugar, egg yolks, and then we can just work the dough together. So that comes together very quickly and we have the perfect sweet pastry. So we just bring that together to form a nice bowl of pastry and that needs to go in the fridge covered for half an hour to rest. Okay so the next step we have to do is the frangipane. So we need to slowly bring milk to the bowl and we're going to flavor this milk with a nice vanilla pod. Okay so for the frangipane we need six egg yolks, a cast of sugar, and we're going to bring that together and we can pour over the hot milk. We're going to add to that flour and ground almonds. Just mix that into the eggs. Okay once we got that mixed in, we're going to add it back to the sauce pan, back over the heat and we just cook it out until it thickens. Okay so I just rolled out the pastry and we are ready to add the frangipane. So the frangipane is thickened up nicely. So we just spread it evenly with a spatula. So once we have a nice coating, we can push our apples into the frangipane. We're going to sprinkle with a few whole almonds and we're ready to bake this in the oven for about 25-30 minutes at 180 degrees. Okay so after 30 minutes in the oven, we have our apple and frangipane tart.",
