    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSo I'm gonna cut a butternut squash and in order to do this right we want to cut the neck off from the base. Start to chop forward sharply to get a good inside cut. Wet the knife in moving a little back and forth as you're moving down with the back part of your knife and then just slide it around and rotate. Now to cut the base of the squash. You can go right down through the center as it's balanced on its base and start with the tip of your knife and again just moving back and forth. Wedging it in as it feels comfortable and safe with the back of your knife. You'll have two halves both with seeds that you'll need to scoop out. \n\nNow that the base of the butternut squash has been deseeded, you can reserve half of it and use it as s bowl for soup or stuff it. The other half we're gonna cut into wedges for roasting. You can start but turning it inside out and we're gonna use the chef knife working back and forth until you get embedded in the squash and chopping down. The sharp knife is really helpful here. Especially cutting into the squash initially. So we have a butternut squash. Half cut and reserved for soup and stuffing and the other half cut into wedges for roasting.",
