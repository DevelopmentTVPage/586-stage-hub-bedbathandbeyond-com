Anything that's very delicate take your time with it; let the knife do the work. Of course I like to go right into it, right down the center. Keep a nice flat surface. And with anything for slicing you can do that way. I prefer the rocking motion so keep you tip on the board and go right across; my fingers nice and crouched. Once you get about halfway, you'll see it get a little difficult. Let it fall. Perfect, look at the beautiful display. A little bit of root nice and clean. Now, something for the grill. Right in half. I like to put a little cross hatch on it. Now the thing with the cross hatch, don't go all on in, just a little incision on top. The deal with that is that it will help get the salt in there and kinda marinade. It looks beautiful for a presentation. This is what I like to do with Endive. Something for the grill something for the salad.",
