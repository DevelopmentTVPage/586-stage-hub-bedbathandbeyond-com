    "transcripts": "[MUSIC PLAYING] This is the rechargeable sensor pump. It's the best way to wash hands because it's touch free. It's a really handy tool when you have greasy hands. Just do this, and you have instant soap. \n\nIt's less messy than traditional pumps because of this silicone valve. It's sealed shut and there's no leak. These buttons control how much soap comes out, and it's easy to refill here. \n\nYou can use any soap, but simplehuman soap was designed specifically for it. The best part about this sensor pump is that it's rechargeable, so there's no need to scramble for batteries. And one charge lasts up to three months. This is the 11 fluid ounce version, and here are the cute 8 fluid ounce versions. Time to wash hands. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
