    "description": "Give your wet laundry the wide open spaces it craves!  The OXO Good Grips Laundry Drying Center offers plenty of drying space without the need to overlap items.  The unique open structure promotes air flow for quicker drying.  It features adjustable drying bars that slide for easy loading and unloading and for customizing your drying space.  The bars are extra thick to reduce creasing.  Additional bars on either side of the Drying Center provide enough extra drying space to hold more than 50 hangers.  Constructed of durable coated steel, the Drying Center can support over 100lbs worth of laundry.  The large steel legs lock into place for maximum stability and have plastic feet that are contoured to protect floors.  When your laundry is dry, simply fold up the Drying Center and secure it with the strap for compact storage.  Air drying is a great way to reduce energy usage, cut utility bill costs and extend the life of garments.",

    "transcripts": "If you've ever shrunken a cashmere sweater so that it fits you cat instead of you, you'll know how important it is to air dry certain articles of clothing. Our drying center features adjustable rolling bars in the center so you can position each bar separately so you maximize the drying space without touching wet clothing. A fully open structure allows for maximum aeration while durable coated stainless steel construction accommodates up to 100 pounds of laundry. Side rails allow you to hang over 50 hangers and large stainless legs lock into place for stability. When not in use the center folds down to a compact  5 inches. It also features a strap that keeps it closed making it easy to tuck next to a washer dryer, behind a door or under a better sofa. Here's a good tip. During product testing, our 110 pound sales manager sat on the laundry center to make sure it could support all of her weight and it did.",
