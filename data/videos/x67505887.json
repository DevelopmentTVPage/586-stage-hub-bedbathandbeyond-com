No aligning. It just drops into position. On high 10 to 15 seconds and I have a perfect ground flag seed I love these simple breakfast shakes. So easy to throw together and yet they're so nutritious. Fresh blue berries in, three straw berries stemmed. What I also love is there is no prep. I can just pour all these ingredients together. Some orange juice or your favorite fruit juice, some really healthy Greek yogurt. You'll give really nice richness. And then the best part is I can switch to the blending blade. It self levels, it finds the sweet spot so easily. I flip it, drop it in, and in just a few seconds I have the perfect shake for the road. ",
