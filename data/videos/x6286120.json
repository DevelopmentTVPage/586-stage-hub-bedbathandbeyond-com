Pulse a few times before running the blender continuously.  With the Cuisinart blending chopping system you can turn any vegetable into any dish for your baby. Using clean filtered water,  steam the vegetables in a pan using as little water as possible to retain maximum nutritional value during cooking. When the vegetables are very soft, allow to cool completely. Place them in the blender along with some of the liquid used to steam the vegetables.  You can also use the chopping cup to puree the vegetables.\n\nHere's another idea. When your baby is ready for Stage 2 foods after around eight months try an egg yolk omelet. Simply cook two egg yolks in a skillet until thoroughly done. Add the eggs along with two tablespoons of any vegetable puree into the chopping cup and add liquid. Pulse a few times then run on low until smooth. The blending chopping system's powerful 350 watt motor allows it to blend food instantly whether you're cooking for a baby or a family it effortlessly crushes ice for mixed drinks.\n\nBlend soups in seconds and whip together homemade vinaigrette in a snap.
