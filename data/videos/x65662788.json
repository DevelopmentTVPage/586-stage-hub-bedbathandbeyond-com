    "description": "Char-Broil\u2019s patented TRU-Infrared cooking system sits above the gas, coal or electric heat source and redistributes the heat, creating in intensely hot cooking surface without hot or cold spots. \n\nWhen infrared, or radiant, energy comes into contact with food, it makes the molecules within the food vibrate, creating heat. Now any natural fire produces infrared energy, but the intensity of the heat is inconsistent. \n\nTRU-Infrared applies more heat to the food and less to the air, resulting in a quicker cook time and food that\u2019s up to 50% juicier.  \n\nIt only takes a few seconds of fire to burn your food. Any drippings are captured by the TRU-Infrared system, preventing flare-ups and redirecting smoke and steam flavors back into the food.  \n\nWith TRU-Infrared cooking technology you can grill with confidence knowing your meal will turn out juicy and delicious every time.",

    "transcripts": "What does Char-Broil TRU-infrared mean? TRU-infrared means even heat across the entire grill. TRU-infrared means no flare ups. TRU infrared means the juiciest food you can imagine. 50% juicier than traditional grilling. TRU-infrared means having everything you want from a grill and more. Here's how it works. When infrared or radiant energy comes into contact with food, it makes the molecules within the food vibrate creating heat. Any natural fire produces infrared energy, but the intensity of the heat is inconsistent. \n\nCharl-Broil's patented TRU-Infrared cooking system sits above the gas coal or electric heat source and redistributes the heat creating an intense cooking surface without hot or cold spots. With a traditional grill you lose much of the energy from the heat source. Those grills actually heat the air instead of the food and can remove moisture from what you're cooking. TRU-Infrared applies more heat to the food and less to the air resulting in a quicker food time and food that is up to 50% juicer. It only takes a few seconds of fire to burn your food. Any drippings are captured by the TRU-Infrared system. Preventing flare ups and redirecting smoke and steam flavors back into the food.\n\nWith TRU-Infrared cooking technology you can grill with confidence knowing your meal will turn juicy and delicious everytime. Look for the TRU-Infrared logo on a variety of Char-Broil gas, charcoal, and electric grills. ",
