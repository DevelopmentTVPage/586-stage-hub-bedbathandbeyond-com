Disconnect the end of one harness from the anchor on the bottom side of the seating area. Unwrap the end of the harness from the metal bar and pull to the top of the seating area. Hook the harness loop to the same anchor from the top of the seating area. Ensure that it is securely connected to the anchor inside the hook. The harness may appear loose but it is secure as long as it is captured within the anchor hook. Repeat on the other side.",
