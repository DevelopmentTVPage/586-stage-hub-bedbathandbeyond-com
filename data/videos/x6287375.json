But every homeowner knows how time consuming and dangerous this job can be. Well now there's an easier and faster way to keep your gutters clean. The I-Robot Looj gutter cleaning robot takes the work and stress out of gutter cleaning. Just set your ladder once, place Looj in your gutter. Detach the remote control handle and use the controls to propel Looj down the length of your gutter and blast out your debris. Spinning at 500 revolutions per minute. The high velocity flexible Auger delivers the power needed to dislodge lift and toss wet leaves, pine needles, and other debris out of your gutters. Just 2 and a quarter inches high 3 and quarter inches wide and waterproof up to one foot of water. I-Robot Looj propels itself through your gutters, under gutter straps, and over downspout holes. When the gutter is clean and it's time to finish up. Looj drives backwards at twice the speed to finish the mission quicker. Simply reattach the remote control handle, hook Looj onto the included belt clip, climb down the ladder and you're all done. And clean up is a snap. Just remove the handle and hose the robot off. So forget dangerous and time consuming gutter cleaning and get Looj the faster easier way to clean your gutters.",
