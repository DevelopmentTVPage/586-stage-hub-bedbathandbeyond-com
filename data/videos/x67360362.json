You get the most control, very sharp, goes right into the tomato. I'm looking for the stem. We gotta get the that out there; it's kinda bitter funky. So I'm gonna make an incision right to the left of it and make a little triangle just like that. You want to rest it on the cutting board. Pops right out. Now the important part with this cut, you wanna follow that center groove right there. that's gonna help you make wedges. Perfect. Nice salsa, What's the secret? I like to use a chef knife. Get a good grip, very sharp, gives me a great length to cut through and it's easier to dice with. Get that stem off. A little bit of compost. Now we want to make some cards so we're gonna go right across. Maybe about 5 6 cuts. We got our cards, stack them up. Now we're gonna go across. Let the knife do the work. The weight of the knife is great. Beef steak. gotta get a flat surface. I'm just gonna put right here on the side. Now I want to keep the stem on, it's really nice to hold on to that. Got a nice flat surface, go right into it. Now that's how I like to do my tomatoes.",
