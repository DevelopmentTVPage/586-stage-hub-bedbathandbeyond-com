The OXO grout brush is perfect for cleaning grout, shower door tracks, fixtures and other small spaces. The tough bristles easily scrub away mildew, grime, and soap scum while the soft comfortable non slip handle provides a secure grip even when wet. Here's a good tip. Try using this brush to clean off muddy sneakers and cleats after a wet soccer game.",
