    "transcripts": "This is the Breville die-cast Hemisphere blender and what makes our blender so unique is the hemisphere system. Our blenders just have two prongs up and two prongs down and all the food gets lost in the blender but with ours we got this block and blade system with these two extra large plates here. This are the serrated blades in the middle with the bowl. So what that does it's like a Vortex so food goes up the side of the bowl and falls onto itself. So there's no that sounds at all so we'll see it in action it's a food processor so we'll see it making ice into snow. Let's put the icing like cell. Beautiful. Look at this already. So look at this powdery white snow look at that see now I'm going to show you the food processor's capabilities of it so what we're going to do me why am I going to do meet because of tartar For mince meat so you know what you're going to be putting into your spaghetti and it'll show you the processor capabilities of the blender but that in press blend Look at that so so true processor and one another Innovation by Breville.",
