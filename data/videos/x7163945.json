    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Paula with Wild Salmon Seafood Market here in Seattle and in the Pacific north west we are known for our salmon and let me tell you a trade secret we have here about our salmon. Not all salmon is created equal. Let's take a look at these fish and I'm going to tell you why. We've got anything from 3.99 a pound to 11.99 a pound. What's the difference? I'm gonna look at our Keta here. Keta is one of the most abundant lower in oil content so this is the one you want to season up, you want to throw a marinade on it. Great fish for doing that. Next we're going to look at our sockeye and our king, high in oil content. Another trade secret, higher the oils content the richer the flavor. These salmon stand alone. They do quite well all by themselves and need very little when you're cooking up. Our coho salmon fall somewhere in the middle. It's okay to throw a little flavor back at it but this one is going to stand alone for you too. So let me leave you with this. When you're buying salmon. Don't worry about price, don't worry about the spices just know how you're  gonna cook it, let your fish monger know, they'll direct you to the right choice.",
