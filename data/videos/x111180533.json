    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Mary Rogers, Director of Marketing Communications for Cuisinart. This is the Cuisinart Hand and Stand Mixer. It's really great because the mixer removes from the stand, so you can use it separately, or you can mount it right on the stand and use it as a stand mixer. It's seven speeds. It has slow start. It also has a read out that tells you what speed you're at. Increase the speed by pressing the plus, or decrease it by pressing the minus. Then you can turn it off just by pressing the button. It has a cord that swings to the left and locks in place if you're right handed,or it swings to the right and locks in place if you're left handed, and that keeps it out of your way when you're mixing.\r\n\r\nNow I'm going to mount it into the stand. You just press it down and it locks into place. Then what I'm going to do is when I turn the hand mixer on, the 3 quart stainless steel bowl will rotate automatically. It continually turns as you're mixing, and like I said, you can increase or decrease the speed by pressing the button on the top. It's 220 watts of power. It's a great hand mixer. The other thing that's nice about it is the tilt back head. You lift it up like that, and you have really, really good access inside your bowl when you want to add ingredients or you want to check on your food. These are the flat beaters. You also notice that one has a flat disc on the bottom. That's what helps rotate the mixing bowl.\r\n\r\nAlso, you get a chef's whisk, which you only need one of those. You can also mount that in the hand mixer. You also get two dough hooks. This is really good for when you're making pizza dough or small batches of bread dough. The same thing, the white piece on the bottom is what auto rotates the bowl. This is a great starting mixer out for any young person getting out on their own in their first home. It's a lot of fun. You can do anything from cake batter to cookie batter to brownies to pizza dough. You can whip cream or meringue in here. It's very versatile. It's really nice looking. Who wouldn't want to have it in their home kitchen?",
