First curl the tips and then the lash line, which instantly gives you lift. Your key step is to work with two mascaras. One that lengthens and one that volumizes. Gently brush one coat of the healthy links mascara along the lower lash line, holding the brush vertically. What I like to do next is add three layers of healthy volume mascara to the upper lashes, wiggling it though the lashes until it reaches the ends.
