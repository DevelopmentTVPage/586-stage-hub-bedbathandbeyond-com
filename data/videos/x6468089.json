    "transcripts": "Dorm room walls are not easy to decorate. You're not allowed to paint or put nails on the wall and they're often brick or cinder block. Fortunately there are 3 ways to get around these problems and personalize your room so you can make your mark without leaving a mark. Number one: Start with the decorator's best friend-- damage-free removable hooks. These special hooks are designed to stick without damaging paint or dry wall. \n\nSince you can use them to hang a variety of light weight objects, they give you lots of flexibility. Try frame dark, a clock, or objects that strike your fancy.  Anything goes as long s it's not heavy. The hooks come in different sizes so make sure you get the one that holds the weight of the item you're hanging. You can even use them for extra storage. Never a bad idea in a dorm room. \n\nWhen it's time to go, you can remove them and it won't damage the walls. Decorating idea number two: There are lots of peel and stick items especially designed with the college student in mind. Sticker frames let you plaster photos and anything else you want to frame all over the walls. and when you want to change them they just easily peel off. Some even come with pockets for extra flexibility.\n\n And decorating tip number 3: Want to write on the walls? No problem, a piece of dry erase boards come in all styles and sizes. So don't let those bare walls scare you. Now you're ready to share your style all over those walls. Get the things you need for college at Bed Bath and Beyond. Shop at your nearest store or online.
