    "transcripts": "We're here at the 2012 house for show at the OXO booth and we're going to give you a sneak peek at the new 3 in 1 Avocados Slicer. Hi I'm Mack I was one of the engineers on this product. I'm Carly a product manager at OXO. Today we are going to show you how our new tool works. So the first step is used this plastic slicing blade to slice the avocado in half. So it sharp enough to go through the skin of the avocado but not sharp enough to hurt your hand so it's safe. The next step is to twist the avocado apart and the pit is going to end up in one half. So this is usually when you use your chef's knife to remove the pit. We invented this new pitting attachment that makes it easier and safer. You can use this hole to pop the pit out to your scrap bin and then turn the tool around where there's slicing blades. So you can use these slicing blades to cut nice even slices out of your avocado, that are perfect for sandwiches or mashing up for guacamole. So turn run it through the tool, you'll get all the avocado out. It really doesn't leave anything behind. Just turn it over and you are done. Uhm so the tool is going to be available in the green that Carly used and the white that I have right here and will see you at a Barbecue this summer.",
