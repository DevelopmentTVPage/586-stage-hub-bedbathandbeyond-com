    "transcripts": "Whether you're making grandma's famous chocolate chip cookies or trying out a new recipe fro a cookie swap, the OXO cookie scoops are an easy way to scoop right from the dough to the cookie sheet. The OXO cookie scoops come in three convenient sizes for easy scooping and consistently round cookies. The small scoop holds about 2 teaspoons of dough and yields 2 inch diameter cookies. The medium scoop holds one and a half table spoons of dough and yields cookies about two and three-quarter inches while the large scoop holds three tablespoons of dough and yields cookies that are about three and a half inches in diameter. All three cookie scoops have soft non-slip grips to absorb pressure and keep hands comfortable while baking. A simple squeeze activates the swipper to release dough from the scoop. These cookies scoops are also dishwasher safe while quick cleanup while your cookies bake. ",
