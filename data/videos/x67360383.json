The colder you meat, the more dense the proteins and easier to cut. The belly is a little bit hard. There's a lot of tissue. The fat's not that great, so the first thing to do is take the belly off. I'm using a utility knife that's small, maneuverable, and has a very sharp tip. Pick rather than a full cut, as you can could possibly cut into the meat. When we're cutting through the ribs to separate them. You just want to follow that meat line down right along the bones so we can end up having the most meat to the chop and as we french them later we can kinda shave that meat down. We'll start with the top with the utility knife. Really use your knife here to draw and slice down through that meat following the rip bone right down. As you get towards the end of the rib and into the spine. Follow that soft line just with the tip of your knife through the ribs and you should be able to really separate it out. The next thing we'll do is cut down the bones so you have a nice clean french bone which is really popular for something called a limb lollipop. One the other side of the bone, cut that meat off. Once you have your bone exposed, clean it up with the sharp side of your knife. Kinda helps get the extra meat off. On those last bits go on with the back of your knife and just slide it down. Here we have a half rack of ribs for roasting, two lamb chops for grilling, and a french lamb lollipop.",
