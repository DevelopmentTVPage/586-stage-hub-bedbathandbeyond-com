    "transcripts": "These are the Breville die-cast two slice and 4 Slice smart toasters. And what makes them so smart is that it's motorized and it is all One Touch so you just have to press it down. we got the innovation of the lifting feature which actually means that the bread Rises up and we can see if we like the Browning or not and then it will just go down And finish the cycle without actually cancelling it. And another great Innovation is the \u201ca bit more\u201d function which is a technical term that the Sydney design team had developed. You press a bit more and then you got 30 seconds into the cycle. And it's always cool to touch too so it's safe in the kitchen. And the other great feature is the crumb tray. You don't actually have to turn the toaster upside down you just take it down and drop it off. And just popped it back in like that. This are the diecast two slice and four slice smart toasters another great Innovation by Breville.",
