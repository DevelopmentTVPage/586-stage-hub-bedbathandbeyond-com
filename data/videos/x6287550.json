    "transcripts": "Exclusively for Bed Bath and Beyond, the hotel neutral comforter and bedding, designed in the studios of Kenneth Cole was inspired by his collection. The first layer of the bed begins with a creme cotton sateen sheet set featuring an embroidered Baroda stitch in warm gold tones at the hem of the sheet and the pillow sham. Adding a subtle dressmaker detail. The hotel neutral comforter and pillow shams subtly ombre from cocoa brown to palest gray through a unique weaving technique. The coordinating pillow shams are finished with a sewn on ribbon trim at the opening edge. The resulting bed is modern and fashion right for any master bedroom. The decorative pillows accenting this bed suites are an ombre velvet pillow, color changing from deepest to palest cocoa brown a random studded canvas rectangular accent pillow, and a long haired faux fur square. The pillows add the key fashion elements to complete this bed look. The hotel neutral comforter and bedding ensemble is part of the Kenneth Cole reaction home collection. It is available exclusively online and at select Bed Bath and Beyond stores.  ",
