    "description": "Cuisinart updates a classic! Our brushed stainless pressure cooker is safe, easy to use, cooks up to 70% faster than conventional methods and cooks healthier, too. Steam trapped in the pot builds up pressure that creates hotter temperatures, and the pot is so tightly sealed that vitamins and minerals can't boil away. Foods stay moist and flavors stay true. Features variable pressure and temperature settings, plus Browning, Simmering and Saut\u00e9 functions for perfect roasts, stews, vegetables, cheesecake or custard. The Cuisinart Pressure Cooker is absolutely safe, with a lid that has to be locked in place before pressure builds, and stays locked until pressure is released. Cook faster, eat healthier, with Cuisinart!",

    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Mary Rogers, Director of Marketing Communications for Cuisinart. Today we're going to talk about pressure cookers. I love pressure cookers; they save you so much time when you're cooking in the kitchen. This one is six quarts; it has a 99 minute countdown timer; it has lots of great features. It has low pressure, high pressure. You can brown using it. You can also saute. You can simmer, and it also has a keep warm feature. \n\nAll you have to do is pick what you're going to do. So, low pressure, high pressure. Then the time you're going to cook it. So say we're going to cook it for 10 minutes. Then you hit Start. And what will happen is, this little light here will blink until it's up to whatever pressure or cooking method you're going to be using. And then once that happens, it'll start counting down the cooking time. And when it's done, it'll beep to let you know it's finished. And then what will happen is, you'll either release the pressure naturally or you'll release the pressure quickly. The quick release method is basically, you move the pressure valve so the steam comes out very quickly. The natural release method is, you wait until the product itself releases the pressure, and then at that point you will be able to open the lid. Our specially designed lid is made so that you cannot open the pressure cooker until the pressure is too totally released. \n\nToday what we did was, just so you can see some of the things that you can make with using your pressure cooker, is we actually made a lentil soup. Now I already made sure the pressure was released from here, so that I could get the lid off to show you the lentil soup. But look how beautiful this looks. It's so easy to use. Like I mentioned, it's six quarts and the pot is removable. And we made a really, really gorgeous lentil soup, which is very healthy. And the one nice thing about pressure cookers is that an item like a lentil or a bean, which takes you a really long time to cook, can be cooked very, very quickly using the pressure cooker. It also comes with a trivet which you can use to do different methods of cooking. But like I said, you can use a pressure cooker; it saves you so much time in the kitchen. It's really great, it's really versatile. And it could be used for so many different things. \n\nAnd there you have it, the Cuisinart pressure cooker.",
