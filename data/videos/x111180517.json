    "transcripts": "Cuisinart\u0099 Griddler\u0099 with Removable Plates\r\n\r\nThis multipurpose appliance is a great addition to any kitchen. Beautifully designed in a brushed stainless steel housing that is also  Cuisinart Griddler w Removeable Platesstay-cool, it can be used as a contact grill, panini press, flat grill and griddle, making it an all-around dynamo. The non-stick grill and removable griddle plates make for easy cleanup. The cooking plates are designed to drain grease. Hinged, floating cover adjusts to the thickness of the food being cooked. It has a selector power knob with a Power On indicator light and two adjustable temperature controls with indicator lights. Comes with two drip cups and a cleaning\/scraping tool. UL listed. Limited 3-year warranty. Model # GR-4.\r\n\r\nHi, I\u0092m Mary Rogers, director of marketing communications for Cuisinart.  This is a the Griddler by Cuisinart.  I love this appliance.  It\u0092s four appliances in one.  It\u0092s a contact grill, so you can grill foods on both sides.  It\u0092s also a Panini press.  It also opens really wide so you can put a thick sandwich or a thick piece of meat.  Also, when you open it all the way, it lays totally flat, and the handle becomes the leg that supports it.  This way, it\u0092s a double grill, but believe it or not, when you pop out the plates and turn them over because they\u0092re reversible, it\u0092s not a griddle. \r\n\r\nThe other thing I love about this is the plates go right in the dishwasher.  It\u0092s really easy to clean up.  You can cook a homemade meal in 15 minutes or less, including the cleanup time.  This way, you see it\u0092s a doublewide griddle.  You can do pancakes on one side.  You can do French toast on the other side.  When you have the grill side in, you can do meat and fish.  You can do lots of vegetables.  If someone is a vegetarian, you can do vegetarian style vegetables on one side and fish or meat on the other side.  The other thing it does is it operates as a Panini press.  You can make any kind of toasted sandwich.  It\u0092s a really great product.  It\u0092s all stainless steel.  It has a beautiful handle.  It also has a removable drip tray right here, which collects the grease for you.  All you do is remove that.  You can wash it by hand or put it in the dishwasher.  \r\n\r\nIt has dual thermostats for grilled Panini and the other one for griddle.  When you operate the griddle, you use the temperature knob here and set the proper temperature for whatever you\u0092re cooking.  It\u0092s the Griddler by Cuisinart.  It\u0092s four appliances in one.  It\u0092s a lot of fun to operate.  It\u0092s very versatile.  When you come home during the week from work, you can get a meal on the table in 15 minutes or less, including cleanup time.",
