    "transcripts": "We're comparing the kitchenaid artisan 5 quart with the newly designed breville 5-quart stand mixer . It's the old versus the new in a head-to-head battle . The challenge, whipping cream . For delicious toppings for foods and desserts, light and airy whipped cream is a must . A smooth and tasty texture is achieved by getting air into your heavy cream which is already naturally thick and you want to be careful not to over mix . We're going to put two cups of heavy cream into each 5 quart bowl . On the kitchenaid were using the highest setting which is 10 and using the handy dial on the breville by turning it to aerate with setting which is 12 . Notice also the much larger wisk. It helps get more air bubbles into the cream end by monitoring the countdown timer you will know for next time how much to mix for 2 cups . Breville is richer creamier and bigger with more volume. That only took seconds, the breville stand mixer see it for yourself; it's built for baking",
