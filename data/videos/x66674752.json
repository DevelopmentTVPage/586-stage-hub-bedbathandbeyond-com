    "transcripts": "We designed our under bust hang with the built in belly support  to alleviate pressure and pain during pregnancy. The X design on the back acts as an anchor to provide ultimate support in the front underneath the belly. We designed our signature belly support tank with an under bust scoop that way you can wear whatever bra is most comfortable to you. So our bottom band actually works as a belly band and allows you to wear it unbuttoned and hold your pants in place. \n\nOur support tanks smooths the hips, sides, and back for a streamline look perfect under any outfit. Nine months is too short to buy a whole new baby bump only wardrobe. But it's too long to be uncomfortable and in pain. So that's why our main focus here is to create designs that make life easier.",
