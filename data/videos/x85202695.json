    "transcripts": "The oversized laundry hamper from Real Simple was designed exclusively from Bed Bath and Beyond. This laundry solution is easy to put together and keeps your clothes organized until you're ready to do laundry. To assemble, first lay out all the pieces in front of you. The pieces are labeled A-K . Start assembling the top of the top of the hamper frame by first establishing pieces E, D, and both Gs. Both frame pieces have push buttons. That lock into place when the frame pieces are inserted into the plastic G pieces. The G pieces have an inner tube and an outer tube. Each tube has a hole in it that locks the frames into place once they're inserted into the part. Take one of the G pieces and holding it so the two locking holes are facing down and Insert D into the inner tube. Inserting by pushing the push button on the frame. When the tube is securely in place, the push button will pop out of the locking hole. \n\nOnce that side of D is securely in place.Take the other G piece and insert the other side of D into the inner tube . Now, take frame piece E. The larger frame piece and insert each end into the outer tubing in each of the G pieces. The top of the sorter is now complete. Next you will need the four A pieces that will be used as the hamper base. I've turned the frame upside down. Insert the straight end, not the curved end, into the G pieces. Now that all the A pieces are inserted into the G pieces, align all the A pieces so the remaining curving end is curving to the inside of the hamper. Next find the pieces labeled B and C and bag labeled IJ. Notice that C is slightly longer than B.  Part C attaches to the outer legs and part B attaches to the inner legs.\n\nUsing the screws, screw each piece into the base. Use the Allen wrench to tighten the screws and make sure they are secure. We're almost done. Let's just add the wheels. There are four wheels in total. Two wheels that lock and two wheels that cannot be locked. You can identify the locking wheels as they have lever on them. Attach the locking wheels to the same side of the base. Then attach the none locking wheels to the other side of the base. Manually screw on the wheels and then use the wrench that's provided to tighten them properly. Now you're ready to attach the fabric sorter. Simply wrap the fabric around the bars and press the Velcro together. This oversized laundry hamper has a removable divider in the center allowing you to have two compartments or one large compartment. The Oversized Laundry hamper available exclusively online and at select Bed Bath and Beyond Stores.",
