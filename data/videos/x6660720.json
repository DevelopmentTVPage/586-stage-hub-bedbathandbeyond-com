These are hydration beads, and we left them to soak or hydrate for 24 hours. We left one as it was, but coated the other with Regenerist and left them for some more time to see how hydrated they remained. \n\nSee that? The untreated bead has shrunk and lost its bounce because it has dehydrated. Hydration of the skin influences its elasticity, so the more hydrated you can keep your skin, the firmer and more elastic it will become.",
