And that's why I have three delicious, yet still healthy, tips for you. 1. Let shrimps be your best friend.  Because whether you poach, grill or stir fry - shrimp has about 1\/3 the calories of its chicken counterpart. 2. Use non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It's way less in calories, it has no fat, but its still delicious, and adds beautifully to anything -  especially baked potatoes with healthy sauteed vegetables. 3. And finally, do you love fish but you don't want a heavy, calorie-laden sauce with it? Simply drain a jar of roasted red peppers, and blend them with a little salt, pepper and garlic. Then just heat, and serve under a nicely grilled piece of fish. There you go, three ideas that for now at least should keep these salads at bay.",
