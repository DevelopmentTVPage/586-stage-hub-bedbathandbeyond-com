    "transcripts": "This time in the chef's corner with Kitchen Aid, we catched up with chef Josh Moore at Louisville Volare Restaurant. He's known for his farm fresh Italian cooking and his irresistible desserts. This time he's making ice cream with a Kitchen Aid artisan design series stand mixer. I've been using Kitchen Aid stand mixers for 22 years in the Louisville Restaurant business. And now he's using the Kitchen Aid ice cream maker attachment. This makes a nice large size batch. Keep the bowl in the freezer, when you're ready the attachment can make up to two quarts of fresh ice cream, sorbet, or any other frozen treat that you can come up with. This is a um vanilla bean ice cream almost like a custard, frozen custard. That's eggs, heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, and vanilla beans. Bowls been in the freezer for 15 hours, and ice cream basically made yesterday so it was already chilled. Just pour that right in, turn it on and let it, let it work its magic. You scream, I scream we all scream for homemade ice cream. We're going to scoop it into a serving dish. I'm going to top this with a couple fresh berries, and an edible flower to finish, and it's ready to serve. With chef Josh Moore I'm Tim Laird in the chef's corner with Kitchen Aid.",
