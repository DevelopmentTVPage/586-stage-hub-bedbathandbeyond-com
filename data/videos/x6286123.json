    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Theresa with Cuisinart and this is our smart stick hand blender with chopper grinder attachment. Today we'll be baking carrot soup and um right now I'm just going to demo the chopper attachment. To grind up some garlic and some onion that we did put into the soup earlier.16 ounce capacity as you can see it did a really great job of chopping up my vegetables. And what you do is press the button on the back, remove the top, excuse me. And there you have the chopped vegetables and we put this garlic earlier. I had done this earlier, we put some garlic and onion inside of the cot and we sauteed it once it was sauteed. I added some chicken stock. Once we got that to a boil I added some carrots, boiled it up a little bit more, and now that the carrots are soft and tender we're going to puree it with the stick blender. So we take the base, we put this on top of the base, place it inside of the soup, and puree. It's important that you keep the stick blender inside of the pot to avoid a mess. Take the stick plunger out, just put it here on the counter. And then I want to garnish it with some fresh parsley which I did chop earlier in the chopper grinder attachment so there you have it Cuisinart's stick blender with chopper grinder attachment.",
