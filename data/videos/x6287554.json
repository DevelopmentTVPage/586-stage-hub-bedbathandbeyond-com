    "transcripts": "Hi, I'm Jess from OXO here to demonstrate why our food mill is the perfect tool for making jams, baby food, sauces, and soups. The food mill comes with three stainless steel disks so you can create fine, medium and coarse textured foods. The stainless steel interior is ideal for hot ingredients and will not stain. Three non-slip legs hold the mill securely over bowls and pots and the broad non-slip handle and knob make it easy to grip the mill and turn the blade. The grinding motion separate seeds and skins from fruits and vegetables. Use the fine disk for home made jellies, jams, or baby food. Use the medium disk for apple sauce and vegetable soups. Finally use the coarse disc for chunkier tomato sauces or mashed potatoes. To switch between discs push the handy release button and remove the bar. Take out the disk and insert the next disc dome side up. Then reinsert the post, position the slot opening under the hook and press the bar down to lock it into place. All parts of the food mill are dishwasher safe and when you're done fold the legs in for storage.",
