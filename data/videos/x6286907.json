    "transcripts": "This is the Breville dual disc juice processor, it takes juicing to the next level. It comes with a \npuree disc so you can enjoy one hundred percent fruit smoothies that we call fruitgies. Freshly made juices taste better and are more nutritious and once you get into the routine of juicing it's hard to go back to the bottle or can variety. Fruitgies are a dairy free smoothie but they have a creamy consistency because they are made from fruit you don't have to pack in the extra calories and thickening agents like yogurt or honey. With the puree disc in place you can juice  berries, mangoes or bananas. For harder veggies and fruits switch out the puree disc with the juicing disc. Five variable speeds allow you customize extraction depending on what you are juicing. For dense hard fruit or vegetables the dial should be up on five with a filter basket spins at 13,000 RPM and for leafy greens and soft fruits switch the dial back to one. Juicing combinations are really only limited by your preferences and as the seasons change taste test new fruit combinations for the ultimate fruitgie factor. And you can start with recipes in the instruction manual and when you've mastered those get creative. The dual disc juice processor another great innovation by Breville. ",
