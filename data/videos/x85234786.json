All over in the little side of this is a place for the balls to go into the little ramps and little holders. A little door that swings open and close. A mail box that you can open and close. And up here, Joey look here, ready? You can put them right down the sides of it and it comes out. And that seems to be her favorite thing she really likes that. Here goes. And see, it goes all the way down. And on this side there's a little flipper that you can put the ball on so you can flip it into the house. It was actually fairly easy to put together. There's just a lot of screws and I would suggest using a drill; that's what I had to do. But as you can see it's a nice little size and he really enjoys it. Are you going to put it up there? Okay. Push, push, push. There alright say bye bye.",
