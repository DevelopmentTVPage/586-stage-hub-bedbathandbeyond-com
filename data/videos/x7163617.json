The foundation of becoming successful becoming great shop but for me and it's what we preach in all our restaurants and from the very beginning we said we're going to treat everyone. Fair we're going to treat the earth fair we're going to treat our farmers fair we're going to do everything that we can in a sustainable fashion and in teary eyed I think before you can be a successful business person you need to be a good person. You know after going to her medical school. I ended up finally getting a job at a restaurant in Manhattan a prefix and it was probably the hardest thing I had ever done in my life was kind of like being part of a. Life like a team.

You know a friend who had a bar and said I'll give you the kitchen you just pay the electricity bill and. He would have tried. So we did. I quit a great job. Started cooking. Made no money. That made a lot of people have a you.

In the first restaurant we just started with nothing so I probably took everything from home and then it was such a superior ploy I took all the money from consulting I bought cookware with because imo right tools for the right job guy he was 35 often saute pans your plate stuff is in use every day. I blacked out after 15 years. It goes a roller coaster ride every night it's pristine. The most amazing thing for me is when you cook it all quieted. It's just a lot easier when the heat is dispersed evenly. And the other thing is that I love that it's made in America. I'm always very proud of things that are made here and that. Help our economy. All the kids have been through all clad is just kind of they are because snow is the best band there is you know domestically and around the world. We did fool around with mother pans that were half hollow handle the Potomac even though the dish station the handles would have water in it et cetera et cetera all plug-in the handles were solid. I'm the alpha girl I have it everywhere and I'd rather. Be",
