    "transcripts": "We've got the big easy all laid out for assembly. I've got it inverted according to the instructions. I've got all the parts laid out, the're aren't very many that I have to attach. I'm just following the instructions here in the assembly manual; makes it real easy. And look at this Char-Broil has even taken everything and put it on one easy to understand identified card. I need one tool to do everything. It's this, a Phillips screw driver. Okay there we go. You really don't need my help putting legs on it but here's a tip I found after building several of these. Just loosely fit them first then use your Phillips screwdriver to tighten up. One down three more to go. Now this could be the most complex thing you do all day and I got to tell you it's pretty darn easy. I've already finger tightened these two self threading screws that hold rotor igniter to this housing. There's a really important thing for your to notice. There's a piece of metal that comes out that connects to this and that when connected to this electric lead, attaches here when I turn the rotary, that's what creates my spark. If you have problems down the road, check that connection. Here's a little tip I have for you when installing the On\/ Off valve. Go ahead and put one of the screws in first. Then when it's time to install, you simply slide it in and now you can tighten it with your screw driver. It will hold it in place and that makes it so much easier when it's time to add the extra screw. When you're attaching the control panel to the main body of the big easy, first one self tapping screw right here loosely fir. You want to make sure this brass feeder goes right inside the burner tube right here. That's a stainless steel tube. That's where the gas comes from. This propane tank hose in and through and you want to have a loose fit so you can slide in your heat shield right here. It will fit at two self tapping screws. Tighten it all up and then connect your electric wire.",
