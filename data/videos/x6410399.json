    "transcripts": "St. Patrick's Day deserves delicious traditional food-- like, say, corned beef. But just because it's traditional doesn't mean it has to be made the same old way. So here's a great corned beef with a little twist. \n\nPut a store-bought three- to four-pound corned beef in a large heavy pot, including any spices in the package. Add a bottle of dark beer, and then add water the rest of the way to cover. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer, and cover. Cook for approximately 2 and 1\/2 hours. \n\nWhile it cooks, combine apricot jam with soy sauce and grain mustard. Mix well, and set aside. When the corned beef is done, remove from the pot, drain, and put on a baking sheet. Spoon the sauce over the top, and put in a 400-degree oven for 30 minutes until you can push a fork in and out really easily. Then just slice and serve. Traditions are meant to be broken-- or at least when they taste this good, they are.",
