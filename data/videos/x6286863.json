This flavorful approach is truly a game-changer! It is worth the effort.",

    "transcripts": "This is right up my alley. So the arresting of power of the the chicken wing here. These wings you know they're just deep fried in hot oil and then rather than glazing them unlike the crystal Louisiana hot sauce and some butter we've glaze them in dashi with yuzu kosho. The Dashi gives us some fishiness, some smokiness, and yuzu kosho gives us this like nice hint of spice kind of floral almost liquoricey note and then we topped it off with a big handful of scallion and a bunch of Bonito flake. For one of the things that strikes me about this pairing. There's a really cool contrast between the fatty character in this and the real real drying character in this beer. Yeah totally. This beer it almost drinks like a champagne it's very very dry. We have brought the right thing to Allagash because wings are a big part of our culture here. Do you guys serve these at the resturant. No but we could start. I've got an idea. Permanent item on the menu and then permanent draw flies. Arwin are you cool with that? Yeah Arwin should do it. We are trying to cut neils . Done and done. These really are phenomenal.",
