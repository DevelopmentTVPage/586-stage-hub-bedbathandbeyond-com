That's what little ocean adventurers will be doing with Dory and friends on this Swim and Swirl Water Table. Fill up the table and get water swirling and wiring with the spinner. Send the figures down the slide into the ocean. Uh oh, did hank just try to escape? Use the side flipper to flip the Dory and friends figures back into the sea. When playtime fun is gone, this table even has a drain plug for easy clean up. So just keep swimming and make everyday an aquatic adventure with Dory and friends.
