    "transcripts": "Rob here, to show you how the new Black & Decker drill with Auto sense technology works it makes those tasks around the house a lot simpler by being able to go from drill mode to our driving mode to put that faster and with a high-performance motor the drill works with different materials and screws eliminating a lot of the guesswork with confusing clutches for best results make sure to apply appropriate pressure behind the drill when in use which allows for the bit to stay firmly within the screw head there's no need to feather the trigger as the auto sense technology will take control and come to a stop when your screw is flush the work surface. If the drill stops short of the desired depth simply recycle the trigger by letting go of the trigger and re pulling it this will help reactivate the auto sense technology during certain applications you may want your screw to be sub flush with the work surface the drill includes a depth control function to allow this when the auto Sense technology stops the screw continue to hold down the trigger and the drill will begin to do small turns to allow micro adjustments for the screw no more frustration missing the mark and damaging your work surface the drill just got smarter with Black & Decker Auto sense.",
