All oysters are anatomically the same so what you want to do is find the hinge which is here, anchor that oyster on your counter and that's as far as I'm taking my tip in. Right there and I'm in the hinge and I'm gonna twist. Little bit of grunting maybe, little but of power and guess what, my oyster is now open. Nothing to it. So I got him open. I'm gonna take this lovely oyster knife here and run him across the top to cut the muscle. This guy is fighting me a little bit but there we go. And now he's attached below so we cut that muscle. So he's gonna slide right out and we have an oyster who is ready to go and that looks awfully good. Beautiful, easy, anyone can do it.",
