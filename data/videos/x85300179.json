This the box it came in so I'm going to go ahead and un-box it. Okay, so this is what was in the box. You got the vacuum cleaner iself and it looks like it has another attachment. So let's test it out because this guy right here sheds a lot. Let's see, the lighting is poor but if you look, I let him sleep on the bed, and there's hair everywhere. You shed a lot don't you. Yeah? You're a good boy. Alright so I'm going to plug this in and I'm going to test this out and see if we some hair off this comforter because it's too big on a washing machine and I just don't like dragging it to the laundry mat all the time. Alright, so I'm going to see if I can record with one hand and use the vacuum with the other. I mean it's small just a little handheld, that is the power button, the container. Alright, let's test this out. Alright that's not bad at all. Especially if I'm doing it while recording and not doing the best of jobs, but it seems to be actually be sucking up the fur which is awesome. I'm surprised he's actually around, he is usually scared around the vacuum cleaner. Anyway so that's what it looks like on a comforter. The fur is trapped in there. So I have huge bed to do so I'm off to do that and I just wanted to give everybody a show of how this product actually works, thanks",
