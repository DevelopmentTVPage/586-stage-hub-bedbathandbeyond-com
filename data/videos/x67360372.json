What we're going to be doing is going around the crown of the pomegranate and it is essential to have a sharp knife as you're doing this. These knives are fantastic with the self sharpening block. Okay, now that we have the top removed, we're going to cut down into segments. So as you're doing this, firmly hold the knife, get int there, and use you're left hand to turn the fruit. Now that we have our segments, we're just going to pull it back nice and gently. Alright quick and easy. We have our pomegranate ready to be seeded and perfect for salads.",
