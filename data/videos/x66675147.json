The first thing we need to do is make our green tapanade. We're using obviously green olives instead of black olives, garlic, come capers. So then we've go anchovies, the we add a nice glug of olive oil and then we're going to star to bring this tapanade together. Okay once that has started to come together, we can add some lemon juice and we're going ot season with a little black pepper. Give it another whisk. Oaky so the tapanade is made, so the next stage we have to make our salad. S owe have a nice bowl here. We're going to start with some cherry tomatoes, some black olives, red onions, we got some diced cucumber-- It's just been peeled and seeded. Feta cheese -- just diced. And the other thing we're going to do is just season our salad with some fresh oregano and we're going to season it again with a little black pepper, olive oil, and some salt. A nice mix up to this salad, it's got lots of flavors, lot's of textures, and lots of lovely colors. So first of all we let our salad to the bowl. I've got here some finely sliced baguette which we just put under the grill fro about thirty seconds on each side just to crisp up. Then we're going to start to spread our tapanada onto these toasts so it's going to add some nice texture to the salad. Green tapanade is a wonderful thing to have kicking around in your fridge at home and we just garnish with a little bit of fresh oregano, top in our crust and that's it. Crispy tomato salad with feta cheese and green tapanade.",
