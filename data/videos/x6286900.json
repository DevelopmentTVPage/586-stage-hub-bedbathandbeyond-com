    "transcripts": "This is the Breville juice fountain plus and it's the perfect juicer for those just getting into the juicing lifestyle. It's easy to use only two settings high and low. Use low to make the blades spin slower for juicing soft fruits and leaky greens. Use the high speed to cut through tougher foods like apples. This is the first juicer to hit the market sporting of three inch feed tube, so you can just whole fruits and vegetables. Even dense vegetables such as beets can go in which are packed with wonderful antioxidants. Really you can try whatever combinations you happen to have in your fridge and after the fun element of experimentation you get to know what you like. Salaries, apples, pears, and carrots all go well with beets. But to give a little extra zing add some ginger root. But go easy on the ginger and build it up as you like to taste because it can over power your concoction. I tend to try fruit and veggie combinations of whatever is in season. A handy trick is to line your whole container with a produce plastic bag. For an even easier clean up. And Breville juicer are easy to clean, you don't need a tool to dismantle it. Simply transfer to the sink give you pots a rinse and place in the top shelf of the dishwasher. There's an included cleaning brush for your filter basket I always use it to give my filter a little extra care right after juicing. The juice fountain plus another great innovation by Breville.",
