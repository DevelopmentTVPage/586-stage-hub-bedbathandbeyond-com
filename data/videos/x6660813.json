I mean real change, and for this I have a 2-step plan. Start by getting rid of anything open if you can't remember the last time you used it. Throw any items with an expired \"use by\" date. And for sure get rid of anything unrecognizable in the freezer. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] \n\nClear storage containers with tight fitting tops are really your best friend. Do what restaurants do. Use a felt pen to date and label the contents. And if you change what's in them, just use a little lighter fluid on a paper towel to clean off the writing. \n\nThe same goes for the freezer. Especially the freezer. A simple date and name will make a huge difference. Purge, then organize. Think of it as spring cleaning, only in January. \n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",
