The All Clad \"Copper Core\" frypan is ideally designed to give you excellent results thanks to its ability to distribute heat effectively. The meat is seared quickly in order to retain its flavour and tenderness. \nYou can make your steak even more delicious and serve it with a creamy and spicy pepper sauce.\n\nTip to seize a meat (without fat): \n\nRun the droplet test. Preheat your frying pan a few minutes. To check if the frying pan achieves the good temperature to seize a meat, deposit a droplet in the center of the frying pan. Once the desired temperature is reached, the droplet is going to divide and occupy a big part of the cooking surface without evaporating.",
