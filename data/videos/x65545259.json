With the design inspired by a pattern found in nature, squeezing for measuring cups make heating up ingredients like butter and chocolate easy and safe. The honey combed patter on the outside of the cups dissipates heat making them safe to touch even right out of the microwave or when holding boiling water. The patter also gives the flexible cups structure, allowing you to easily hold and squeeze the silicone cups from a narrow spout for precise pouring. The cups feature convenient measurement markings and flat basis for stability in the microwave and on counter tops. The cups come in four cup, 2 cup, one cup, and mini sizes. When you;re done using them, clean up is a snap. Simply put them in the dishwasher or rinse them out for easy cleaning. Here's a good tip, the four cup size is perfect for easily filling a muffin pan with your favorite cupcake of muffin batter.",
