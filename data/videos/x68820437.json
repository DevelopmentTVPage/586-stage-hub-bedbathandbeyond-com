    "transcripts": "Double the spirals double the fun with the OXO handheld 2 blade spiralizer. With this spiralizer you an create pasta like dishes, curly fries that you can bake, or even garnishes. The spiralizer features two stainless steel color coded blades with an open blade design. Green for 1\/8 inch spaghetti curls, and orange for 1\/4 inch fettuccine spirals. It has a non slip grip for comfort and a food holder to protect hands when in use that doubles as a cover for safe storage. To begin, twist to remove both blades and food holder from the spiralizer. Select the blade you want to use and twist to secure into the the no slip body. Cut the ends of the food or vegetable so they're flat and even, and place the flat end against the blade. Apply pressure while twisting the vegetable clockwise to get long uniform spirals. Spiralizing works best when the produce is straight and at leas tone and a half inches in diameter. If the produce is longer than 6 inches, jut cut it in half. If it isn't naturally straight, cut it into straight sections. When you start to reach the end of the fruit or vegetable, use the food holder for safety to keep your finger away from he sharp blade. A few twists later, you have a plate of delicious and healthy vegetable noodles that you can dress up however you like. The spiralizer comes apart for easy cleaning, is dishwasher safe and locks together for storage. Here's a good tip, use your spiralizer to make dicing vegetables quicker and easier by using an OXO pairing knife after spiralizing",
