    "transcripts": "We're here with our friends at primo restaurant in maine . And melissa kelly you've been using the breville stand mixer for some of your dishes . I am this is one of our more popular dessert that is on the menu. It is a lemon meringue napoleon . The good thing about this mixer that it's so quiet .It doesn't disturb or interrupt anything so that's a great feature . So what we have here in the bowl is some egg whites and sugar that we heated over a double boiler on a waterbath just until 120 degrees until the sugar is melted . And we're making a swiss meringue . Just for the first few minutes we'll get it going and crank it up . All right off we go into 12 which is the air 8 and the highest . And this is a feature that we're looking for . This whip is so nicely shaped that it's almost going to take no time which is really helpful for me when you need things on the fly . Selling the timer we have already been doing this for 2 minutes 30 seconds. Which is great if I'm making desserts and making meringue at the same time I don't even have to pay attention to it .It. And actually beep and it's a great feature.Okay so here we go . We're going to mix this up a little bit . It's so nice and fluffy . I love that shape of the whip . It's so firm and it doesn't even  drip. And this is wonderful silky smooth and this is because of the 360 degrees planetary motion with that wonderful bowl shaped whisk . Now we are on to the garnish of the lemon maria napoleon so melissa let's get started. We just have here a pint of heavy cream to make a little bit of whipped cream. We call this the chantilly cream which is just adding a little bit of a superfine sugar do that too lightly sweetened . You don't want it to be too sweet and then just a little touch of vanilla extract . So what would you like me to put on the timer?  We will put it for 1 minute . And then we're going to start out slow and when it begins to thicken we're going to slowly ramp it up. So we're going to let this up and then take a look and what we are looking for as for the cream to be fluffy.  It's effortlessly whipped cream in under a minute when it usually takes over 2 minutes but not with the breville stand mixer it's amazing it's the perfect garnish for the lemon meringue napoleon . So prices here to heat up the desert . We put a little bit of meringue. A little bit of cream and white chocolate and wild huckleberry sauce . And there we have the perfectly plated lemon meringue napoleon by primo . \n",
