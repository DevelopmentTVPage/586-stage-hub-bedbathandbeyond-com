    "transcripts": "Your Hoover t-series bagged vacuum has excellent filtration that starts with the filtration bag. Inside the bag door below the bag is a secondary filter that protects the motor from dirt and debris. If the secondary filter becomes dirty you can rinse this filter in cold water to clean. Wait 24 hours for the filter to completely dry before putting it back into the cleaner. Never place a damp or wet filter back into the vacuum cleaner. At the side of the bag there is also a final filter where exhaust air is returned to the room. Pull the tab on the filter holder down to remove, you can rinse this final filter in cold water as well. Once the filter is completely dry you can place it back into the filter holder, and push the holder back into the cleaner. Remember never put a damp or wet filter inside your vacuum cleaner. ",
