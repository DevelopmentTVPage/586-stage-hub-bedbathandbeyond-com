So the first thing we're going to do is make some crushed ice. So we'll add some nice cubes to here. Okay amazing, which we can now spoon into our glasses. Okay now we're ready to make our smoothie. So we need to first add our bananas. Some freshly grated ginger. Some nice thick natural yogurt. A spoon full of honey, clean honey. Some orange juice and some lime juice. Okay so now with the cordless, we'll just bring that to a nice puree. Okay, so with the cordless multi-quick. It takes us seconds to make a wonderful fresh energizing smoothie. Just pour it on the crushed ice. Okay and there we have it. Banana orange and ginger  smoothie.",
