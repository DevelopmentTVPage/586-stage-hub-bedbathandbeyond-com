We\u2019ve also trapped allergens and pollutants in fact according to the Environmental Protection Agency the average home maybe up to five times more polluted than the air outside there are naturally occurring household pollutants like pollen and mold spores but there are other pollutants too. From things like scented candles, antiperspirant, pollen, pet dander, household cleaners, and air fresheners. This is what's happening in our homes every day and because many of our homes and more sealed these days the pollutants and allergens can't escape. However, they can be captured this is the Dyson pure cool link it\u2019s engineered to clean the allergens and the pollutants from the air in your home and it's intelligent purification means you can keep track of the air quality in your home.",
