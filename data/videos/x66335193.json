Today we have one couple who one loves minimal while the other loves bohemian. So let the design mashup begin. To start, we kept the walls neutral and we used the floor as the fifth wall to give us that added pop. \n\nUse straight lines in your furniture to keep the pattern's felling clean. For a minimal effect, keep the wood tones the same. When your mixing patterns, keep the scale of them different. The rug is a really busy patter while the chair has a much bigger bolder pattern. So they are not competing against one another. Color is what's filling this space - not stuff. \n\nFor pillows, keep it to a colored texture and not a pattern to visually fill the space. Replicate the shape of the accessories and use bigger accessories to keep the room from feeling too cluttered. Combining styles is all about give and take not compromise. Don't be afraid to combine styles because in the end it can actually create a richer look. You can find everything you see here from bold styles online at Bed Bath and Beyond.com",
