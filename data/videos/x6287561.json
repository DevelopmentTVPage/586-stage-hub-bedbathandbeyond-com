    "description": "It has been more than 10 years since we introduced the first OXO Salad Spinner. At the time, salad spinners were still a novelty item and not the kitchen staple they are today. But a lot can change in a decade from new materials and manufacturing technologies to extensive product testing and user feedback. It seemed like the right time to overhaul what is now one of our most recognized items. The most noticeable difference is the shape of the bowl which has a wider base, flat top and dare we say an elegant look. The non-slip ring on the base has been redesigned to do an even better job sticking to the counter when spinning at top speed. The flat top of the Spinner makes storage much more convenient in either the refrigerator or cupboard. To allow for more greens or berries to be dried, the size of the pump mechanism has been reduced to accommodate more arugula or frisee. For ultimate convenience, the underside of the lid comes apart with the simple press of a button to clean all surfaces. In addition, we reengineered the built-in break to work like car brakes and stop on a dime. The Salad Spinner still features a soft, non-slip knob that activates the pump mechanism and because we know people like options, the Spinner is available with a green or clear basket.",

    "transcripts": "Hi I'm Laurey from OXO one of my favorite tools from my kitchen is my salad spinner. I often eat salad with dinner and this spinner makes prep time fly by. The OXO salad spinner uses a simple easy one handed pump motion. It was originally inspired by a children's pop on a visit to a toy store. Let me show you how it works. First wash your greens directly in the basket it doubles as a colander so it's easy to strain your greens once there washed. For grittier greens like spinach or ... you can start by soaking them in a bowl. After Staining the lettuce place the basket back in the bowl and secure the lid on top. Then just give the spinner a few easy pumps to get it moving. The base is wide and has a non slip bottom to prevent it from toppling while spinning. When you're finished just press the brake right here and the spinner stops automatically. Just lift the lid and your lettuce is dry. All the water is on the bottom of the bowl. For serving the bowl is attractive enough to bring to the table. Clean up is a snap, the lid comes apart easily for thorough cleaning and all parts are top rack dishwasher safe,. When you're done simply lock the pump in place. For convince storage the lid is flat so you can stack items on top. Are salad spinners are available wherever OXO products are sold.",
