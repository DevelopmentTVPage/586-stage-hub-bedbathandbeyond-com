It has a soft comfortable bulb shaped handle that won't spin as your hand and the whisk flattens as you press down so that you can completely deglaze the pan. Here's a good tip, scrape off all the fond off your saute pan with your flat whisk. Fond is the caramelized brown bits built up from high heat cooking.",
