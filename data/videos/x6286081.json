Everyone knows I like to entertain with a twist and with this spiralizer attachment for my KitchenAid stand mixer it's more fun than ever. This attachment gives me all kinds of new ways to be creative and eat healthy. It's the first tool of its kind to take advantage of the power and hands free operation of the stand mixer. By using a combination of accessories, the spiralizer can do several things at once like peeling, slicing and coring all kinds of fruits and vegetables. I use it to make easy work of mashed potatoes because it takes the pain out of peeling. Watch this, how easy it is with this attachment. Just go to four and automatically it will peel the potato. And it's just that easy. You can even make easy curly fries. This is go to gear for the adventurous home cook who wants to eat healthy and explore fresh ideas for culinary creativity. I'm Tim Laird in the chef's corner with KitchenAid.",
