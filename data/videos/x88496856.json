To begin remove product contents and group all like parts, extend each side support so that the movable part is on top. Snap the top movable part into place on each side this locks the sides in an open position, lay each side support on its side like you might face your partner in bed when you aren't mad at one another. Insert the middle support bars into each side support making sure that they are seated securely, next insert the remaining support bars and continue connecting the side supports. Now lift the drying rack into an upright position and finish inserting the upper support bars. There you have it a drying rack that can appear and disappear, simply unsnap the movable top of the rack lower and like magic it's gone. Now if only you could say that about all that wet laundry you need to dry. At honey can do we don't believe you have to go broke to have a beautiful well-organized home and assembly should be easy to do.",
