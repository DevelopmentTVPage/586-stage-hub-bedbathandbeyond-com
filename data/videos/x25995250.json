The sturdy, lightweight aluminum body extends to 54\" long with a quick twist to easily dust those hard-to-reach places. The Duster head rotates 270 degrees and locks at multiple angles, depending on your cleaning needs. Lock the Duster head in a vertical position to clean ceiling vents and light fixtures or at a right angle to remove dust from the tops of bookshelves and cabinets. When you're done with one side, simply rotate the head to use the clean side of the duster head for extended cleaning.",
