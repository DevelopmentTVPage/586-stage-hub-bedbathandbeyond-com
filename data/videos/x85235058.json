    "transcripts": "Thank you Step2 for letting me test this product of the toy tester program. Once we received and opened the box, my little girl and I put all the pieces on the floor to start assembling the Coupe. It took us about and hour to put all the pieces together and all we needed was a hammer and a screwdriver. After waiting patiently overnight, our baby girl put it to the test the next day as soon as she woke up. She enjoyed all the features and the colors of the coupe were the first thing that got her attention. She loves the latching door which is easy on her hands. She played with the gas cup, which she prefers to leave it open, the horn, and the clicking key. It's very solid and it's so light that's it's so easy to take it up and down the stair to ride it around our complex. She took her drinks taking advantage of the cup holders. And used the storage and the hood to take some some toys to ride with her. Overall, the riding the Easy Turn coupe by Step2 was lots of fun and we loved it.   ",
