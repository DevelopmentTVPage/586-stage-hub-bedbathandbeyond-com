    "transcripts": "Hello, this is Joann and here's the Rohm portable sound machine, \"serious sleep on the go\". To tell you here's the back of it. I seriously couldn't use one of these when I first moved here. I moved here from the country where it was nice and quiet and here we have a bar down the street and the folks get out at one thirty in the morning and they're yelling and screaming at each other. You've got rap music going by-- it's loud. Man I lost so much sleep and I tried a CD player but I couldn't go to sleep to music-- it was terrible. So this is going to be nice. Alright it's got the little USB for powering it. Pop it out. Okay, it says, \"Hold for three seconds to turn on\/ off unit\". Here's the power. One...two...three. Here's power and then you have the volume buttons. Let's turn this down a little. Sure press to choose bright white noise, deep white noise, or surf. So let's see. Oh I like that much better. Alright let me hold this up to the microphone. Alright I've got to saw that is pretty cool. I don't know if you like that or not but I don't know god I love that sound in the surf. I'm a California girl. Oh Yeah! Sweet! Yeah I recommend this. This is nice! Thanks for watching.",
