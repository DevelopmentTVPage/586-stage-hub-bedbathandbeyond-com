Your dry ingredients the flour the sugar in the salt go into the food processor with the lard and then you just going to pulse it for 10 to 15 times. You're gonna put the egg in and then you can add the buttermilk. Stir it up with a fork. Mush it together into a ball. And then you can I want to cover it in plastic wrap. That goes in the refrigerator for about an hour and during that time you can make your filling. The fillings are really easy to make it's just fruit and sugar. I just put it in a pan cook it down just for a little bit. I usually go about eight minutes. So now ready to roll out the dough. You're gonna put some flour down on the surface and roll the dough up and I like to use these little pine molds they work really well. We're just going to put a couple tablespoons of our filling. And then what's really cool is that it crimps the the edges together perfectly. Now you're empanadas are ready to go into the hot oil. Want to bring the oil to 365 degrees and when it's hot, drop them into the oil kind of carefully they're going to go for about three minutes on each side and then flip them. When they're golden brown. Grab them with some tongs and shake all those sort of excess oil off and then let them drain on paper towels. I love to plate these empanadas with ice cream. You can you can serve on a plate and then I use the ice cream in the scoop to kind of crush the belly of the empanada. It looks neat on the plate and there you have it there is my sweet empathize with lots of different things on the inside.",
